<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>For the gratification of my old comrades and in grateful
memory of their constant kindness during all our
years of comradeship these records have been written.
The writer claims no special qualification for the task
save as it may lie in the fact that no other survivor of the
Company has so large a fund of material from which to
draw for such a purpose. In addition to a war journal,
whose entries cover all my four years service, nearly every
letter written by me from camp in those eventful years
has been preserved. Whatever lack, therefore, these pages
may possess on other lines, they furnish at least a truthful
portrait of what I saw and felt as a soldier. It has
been my purpose to picture the lights rather than the
shadows of our soldier life. War is a terribly serious business
and yet camp life has its humor as well as its
pathos, its comedy as well as its tragedy, its sunshine as
well as its shadows.</p>

<p>As Co. B, of the Oglethorpes was an outgrowth of the
original organization, its muster roll before and after
reorganization, with a condensed sketch of its war service
has been given. For this information I am indebted
to the kindness of Mr. Frank H. Miller and Mr. Brad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Merry, as I am to the former also for data pertaining to
the early history of the Oglethorpes.</p>

<p>Aside from the motive already named, there is another
which has had some influence in inducing me to publish
these memories. In the generation that has grown up
since the '60's, there is a disposition to undervalue the
merits of the "Old South" and to discount the patriotism
and the courage, the sacrifice and the suffering of
those, who wore the grey. If these pages shall recall to
my old comrades with any degree of pleasure, the lights
and shadows of our soldier life, or shall bring to the
younger generation, to whom the Old South is not even
a memory, a truer conception of "the tender grace of a
day that is dead" I shall be more than repaid for the
labor involved in their preparation.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<h3>EARLY HISTORY OF THE OGLETHORPES.</h3>


<p>On a winter's day in '51, in the old Capital at Milledgeville,
Ga., Howell Cobb, then Governor of Georgia,
gave his official sanction to an Act of the General Assembly
incorporating a new military organization in the
City of Augusta. If he had been told that ten years from
that date he would be wearing the wreath of a Brigadier
General in actual war and that the Company, to which his
signature had given legal existence would be camped
on Virginia soil, attached to the command of an officer,
who will go down into history as one of the greatest captains
of the ages, he would have smiled at the statement
as the outgrowth of a distempered fancy. And yet such
a prophecy would have found literal fulfilment.</p>

<p>In honor of the founder of the Georgia Colony the
Company was named the Oglethorpe Infantry. Hon.
Andrew J. Miller, was its first commander. Representing
some of the best blood of one of the most cultured
cities of the Old South, the company, by its proficiency
in drill and its military bearing soon gained a distinguished
position among the citizen soldiery of the State.
On the death of Capt. Miller in 1856, Judge Ebenezer
Starnes was chosen to succeed him. He, in time, was fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>lowed
by John K. Jackson, afterwards a Brigadier General
in the Confederate Army. During the captaincy of
the last named, the volunteer companies of the State
were ordered into camp at Milledgeville, Ga., by Gov.
Herschel V. Johnson. Capt. Jackson, on account of illness
in his family, could not attend and the Oglethorpes
were commanded by Lieut. J. O. Clark. In the military
drill and review, that occurred during the encampment
the Oglethorpes presented the best marching front of
any company present. Mr. Frank H. Miller, then Orderly
Sergeant, attributes their success on this line, in part
at least to the fact that nature had failed to endow him
with a full share of what my father was wont to term "legability,"
and his shortened step, as Company Guide,
rendered it an easier task for his comrades marching in
column of companies to preserve their alignment.</p>

<p>On the organization of the Independent Volunteer
Battalion in 1857, Capt. Jackson was elected Lieut. Col.,
and Lieut. J. O. Clark succeeded to the captaincy, retaining
the position until the Company was mustered into
the Confederate service in 1861. Of the original roll as
organized in 1851, if my information is correct, only Mr.
William Richards now survives. Capt. Horton B.
Adams, who died during the present year (1899) was the
last surviving member of the original roll, who retained
active connection with the Company from its organization
until its enlistment in the Confederate Army.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h3>OFF TO THE WAR.</h3>

<p>Prof. Joseph T. Derry, who served with the Oglethorpes
from their enlistment until his capture at Kennesaw
Mountain; in July, 1864, has kindly furnished the
following sketch of their war service prior to my connection
with the Company:</p>

<p>"Following the lead of four of her sister States Georgia
passed an ordinance of 'Secession,' Jan. 19, 1861.
Gov. Brown ordered the seizure of all Federal property
within the limits of the State, and on Jan. 24 the volunteer
companies of Augusta, consisting of the Oglethorpe
Infantry, Clinch Rifles, Irish Volunteers, Montgomery
Guards, Washington Artillery, Richmond Hussars, and
two companies of 'Minute Men,' afterwards organized
into the Walker Light Infantry, with a company of
infantry from Edgefield, So. Ca., and two hundred
mounted men from Burke county, marched up to the
Augusta Arsenal and demanded its surrender.</p>

<p>Capt. Elzey, afterwards a Brigadier General in the
Confederate Army, was in command, and having only
a small force in the barracks, he promptly complied with
the demand.</p>


<h3>ORGANIZATION OF FIRST GA. REGIMENT.</h3>

<p>The efforts to secure a peaceable separation from the
Union having failed, the Augusta companies promptly
offered their services to the Confederacy. The Oglethorpes
and Walker Light Infantry were the first two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
accepted. On March 18, 1861, the lists for the Oglethorpes
were opened at their armory on Reynolds
street. Sterling C. Eve was the first to enroll his name,
and Virginius G. Hitt was the second.</p>

<p>As the Company had in its ranks a larger number
than would be accepted, married men were excluded,
except as commissioned officers. In the closing days of
March, orders were received from the War Department
for these two companies to rendezvous at Macon, Ga.
On April 1st they were escorted to the Central R. R.
Depot by all the volunteer companies of Augusta, while
the entire city, apparently, turned out to witness their
departure and to bid them God speed on their mission.</p>

<p>On April 3rd the First Volunteer Regiment of Ga.
was organized with the following corps of field officers:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Colonel, James N. Ramsey, Columbus, Ga.<br />
Lieut. Colonel, James O. Clark, Augusta, Ga.<br />
Major, Geo. H. Thompson, Atlanta, Ga.<br />
Adjutant, James W. Anderson, Newnan, Ga.<br />
Quartermaster, Andrew Dunn, Forsythe, Ga.<br />
Commissary, Geo. A. Cunningham, Augusta, Ga.<br />
</p>

<p>The enlistment dated from March 18, '61, and the regiment
was composed of the following companies:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
A. Newnan Guards, Capt. Geo. M. Hanvey.<br />
B. Southern Guards, Capt. F. S. Wilkins.<br />
C. Southern Right Guards, Capt. Jno. A. Hauser.<br />
D. Oglethorpe Infantry, Capt. Horton B. Adams.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>E. Washington Rifles, Capt. S. A. H. Jones.<br />
F. Gate City Guards, Capt. W. L. Ezzard.<br />
G. Bainbridge Independents, Capt. Jno. W. Evans.<br />
H. Dahlonega Volunteers, Capt. Alfred Harris.<br />
I. Walker Light Infantry, Capt. S. H. Crump.<br />
K. Quitman Guards, Capt. J. S. Pinkard.<br />
</p>

<p>The patriotism of Augusta is evidenced by the fact
that in this, the first regiment organized, she had larger
representation than any city in the State. On the date of
its organization Gov. Brown reviewed the regiment and
delivered an address that aroused much enthusiasm. A
few days later we left for Pensacola, via Montgomery,
Ala., then the Capital of the new Confederacy. Between
Garland and Evergreen, Ala., there was a gap of sixteen
miles, over which the boys had to take the peoples' route
as there was no railway connection. It was their first
march and as their feet grew sore and their untried muscles
wearied by the unaccustomed strain upon them,
they began to ask the citizens they met: "How far to
Evergreen?" "After you pass the next hill and reach the
rise of another it will be five miles," said one. This point
reached, another was asked the question. "Six miles,"
he said. Tramping along the dusty highway, another
traveler was met, "How far to &mdash;&mdash;." "For the Lord's
sake," said Tom Eve, "don't inquire again. The road
gets longer every time you ask."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h3>AN AMENDMENT TO THE TABLE OF LONG
MEASURE.</h3>

<p>While not germane to the matter under discussion my
friend, Joe Derry will pardon I know a slight interruption
in his story, suggested by the incident just related.
Passing through the piney woods of Richmond county
some years ago the writer stopped at a country home to
secure proper direction as to his route. A lady came to
the door and in answer to my questions, said she was
unable to give the information, but suggested that I
might be enlightened at the next house. "How far is
the next house?" I asked. "About twict out o' sight,"
she replied, and I went on my way with at least the satisfaction
of having secured for the "table of long measure,"
that had worried me in my school boy days, an
amendment, that in originality if not in definiteness, was
literally "out o' sight."</p>

<p>"Straggling into Evergreen, next morning, we reached
Pensacola by rail that evening, spent a day in the town
and then sailed down the beautiful bay, past the navy
yard at Warrenton, and so close to Fort Pickens that its
guns could have blown us out of the water. Landing near
Fort Barrancas, we marched to our camping place, half
a mile beyond and near the magazine. Our stay here was
marked by no special incident, the time being spent in
drilling, regimental and picket duty, unloading powder
from a sloop and filling sand bags to strengthen the front
of Fort Barrancas.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>About the last of May, orders were received for the
transfer of the regiment to Virginia. Steaming back to
Pensacola, the Oglethorpes were met by a delegation
from the Clinch Rifles, 5th Ga. Reg., by whom they
were conducted to the quarters of that company and royally
entertained until our departure next day. The pleasure
of the occasion was marred, however, by the death
of Bugler Parkins, of the Clinch, caused by the bite of a
small ground-rattlesnake. On reaching Augusta the
Company received an ovation as great as that accorded
them on their departure for Pensacola. Three days in
Augusta and then we were off for Richmond, where we
met with a very hearty reception. At our camp we were
reviewed by President Davis and Gov. Letcher, both of
whom addressed the regiment. About the middle of
June we were off for Staunton by rail, stopping at
Waynesboro to partake of a bountiful feast prepared for
us by the ladies and served on rough pine tables in picnic
style."</p>

<p>(Col. C.H. Withrow, then a resident of Waynesboro,
recalls the incident and says that he was strongly impressed
with the appetite shown by the boys on that
occasion, that the presence of beauty did not prevent
them from doing ample justice to the spread.)</p>

<p>"At Staunton the regiment was entertained by a concert,
in which the children of the Blind Asylum sang
patriotic Southern airs. A few days later we were on the
march to re-inforce Garnett at Laurel Hill. About mid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>day
of the first day's march the patriotism of the Virginia
ladies manifested itself again in a bountiful feast prepared
for us in a beautiful grove, while from a rock near
by there gushed forth a bold spring of almost ice-cold
water. A night or two afterward, we camped at the foot
of Cheat Mountain, in a beautiful valley, at the Southern
end of which some time later we were stationed for several
months, confronting a Federal force under Gen.
Reynolds on Cheat Mountain. A young lady living near
our camping ground entertained us with Southern
songs, with a melodeon accompaniment, some of the
boys singing with her. Two nights later, at Beverly, we
encountered a fearful storm, which blew down every
tent and repeated that interesting performance every
time we put them up.</p>

<p>Reaching Laurel Hill we found that service in West
Virginia was far more serious business that at Pensacola.
Picket duty was heavy and soon became dangerous.
McLellan with 20,000 men, began his advance early in
July. To oppose this force Garnett had only 4,500 men,
many of whom were in the hospital. Exposure had produced
much sickness and here occurred the first death
among the Oglethorpes, that of Dillard Adams, a good
soldier and a true man. On July 7th Gen. Morris took
position in our front with 8,000 men, while McLellan,
with the remainder of his force advanced on Rich Mountain,
held by Col. Pegram with 1,300 of Garnett's command.
On July 8th the 1st Ga. moved out in front of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Laurel Hill to feel the enemy's position. We soon
encountered their skirmishers, who after shelling woods,
attempted to seize a small round hill in front of Belington.
Lieut. Col. J. O. Clark quickly deployed his men
and exclaiming, "Up the hill, boys, and remember you
are Georgians," led a gallant charge, which drove the
enemy back with some loss. Skirmishing continued until
July 11th, when Garnett learned that Rich Mountain had
been captured by Rosecranz.</p>


<h3>THE LAUREL HILL RETREAT.</h3>

<p>The capture of Pegram's position and of a large part
of his force necessitated the evacuation of Laurel Hill,
and Garnett began his retreat towards Beverly, sixteen
miles distant. After two-thirds of the distance had been
covered he was falsely informed that the enemy had
already occupied that place, and retracing his steps
almost to his abandoned camp, he turned off towards
Beverly, crossing, by an almost impassable road, over
Cheat Mountain into the Cheat River valley and
intending by turning the mountains at their Northern
end to regain his communications. On July 13th we
were overtaken by the Federals between Kalers and Corricks
fords. The 1st Ga. and 23rd Va., with a section of
artillery under Lieut. Lanier, and a cavalry force under
Capt. Smith, were formed into a rear guard to protect
the wagon train. At Carrick's Ford the 23rd Va. suffered
considerably and a part of the wagon train was cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>tured.
The larger part of six companies of the 1st Ga.
and including the Oglethorpes, failed to hear the order
to retire and held their position until the enemy had
passed. Cut off from the main force and with no avenue
of escape except the pathless mountains, that hemmed
them in, they wandered for three days with nothing to
appease their hunger except the inner bark of the laurel
trees. On the third day, famished and worn out, they
stopped to rest, when Evan Howell proposed that he
and another member of the regiment would go forward
and endeavor to find an outlet or a pilot to lead them to
an inhabited section. He fortunately met with a mountaineer
named Parsons, who took them to his home,
called in his neighbors, killed a number of beeves to
feed the famished men and then piloted them safely to
Monterey.</p>

<p>Gen. Garnett, who was with the main column, had
been killed, after passing Carrick's Ford, while withdrawing
his rear guard and his force under Ramsey and
Taliaferro marched all night and succeeded in passing
the Red House and turning the mountain before Gen.
Hill, who was sent by McLellan to intercept them, had
reached that point. They were now on fairly good roads,
in friendly country and at Petersburg, W. Va., the people
turned out en masse to feed the exhausted Confederates.
From this point they retired by easy marches to
Monterey. The campaign, undertaken with a small force,
to hold an unfriendly section, had proven an expensive
failure."</p>

<h3>DONNING THE GREY.</h3>


<p>About midday on Dec. 20, 1860, the writer sat in an
audience room in Macon, Ga., listening to an address
delivered by Hon. Howell Cobb to the Cotton Planters'
Convention, then in session in that city. After all these
years my memory retains no trace of that address in
either theme or outline. I do recall, however, an interruption
in its delivery, remembered, possibly, because
it threw a crimson tint over the years that followed it, and
for the further reason that if there had been no occasion
for such an interruption, these records might never have
been written. While Mr. Cobb was speaking, a messenger
entered the hall and handed him a telegram. He
broke the seal, glanced over its contents and then read
the following message to the audience: "The South
Carolina Convention has just passed the Ordinance of
Secession from the Union." From that moment the
"Cotton Planters' Convention" was no longer in it. The
audience became a howling mob. That night there was
a torchlight procession with brass band accompaniments.
The streets were packed with a solid mass of
excited, fevered, yelling humanity. The people were
simply wild for Southern independence and the scene
was probably duplicated in every Southern city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early months in '61, when all hope of a peaceful
separation had passed, the war fever attacked first the
towns and cities where the people were in constant touch
with each other and where the daily press kept the public
pulse at more than normal beat. As the demand for
troops increased, the infection spread to quiet country
places with their monthly church service and their weekly
mail. And so in due time it reached the community in
which I lived, a community of quiet, well-to-do farmers,
whose knowledge of Jomini and the art of war was
decidedly limited. A military organization of thirty of
forty men was, however, effected and Mr. John D. Mongin,
the only member who knew the difference between
"shoulder arms" and "charge bayonet," was elected captain.
Our weekly drills at the academy grounds were
confined largely to marching in single rank to the music
of a rustic drummer and fifer, who seemed in blissful
ignorance of anything but "slow time." There was a
short-legged Frenchman in the company, whose number
was "32" and, who in counting off, always responded
with "dirty too." A year or two later those of us, who
had seen actual service, could probably have made the
same response without impairing in the least our reputation
for veracity. As there was not sufficient material
in the community to form a full company, my brother
and myself, with D. W. Mongin, A. J. and J. H. Rhodes,
made application to the Oglethorpe Infantry, 1st Ga.
Regiment, then at Laurel Hill, Va., for admission into its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
ranks, and were accepted. Leaving Augusta July 31,
1861, in company with George Pournelle and Ginnie
Hitt, who were returning from a ten days' furlough, we
stopped over in Richmond a day and visited the Confederate
Congress then in session. Sitting in the gallery
of the Senate Chamber looking down upon Alex Stephens
in the chair and Bob Toombs, Ben Hill, E. A. Nisbet
R. M. T. Hunter and other worthies in the Hall, Luke
Lane, an old college classmate, wrote on the fly leaf of
the pocket diary, from which these records are partly
taken a sort of preface, closing it with these words:
"Here's hoping that every Yankee may find a bloody
grave;" and Ginnie Hitt, sitting by, wrote beneath it:
"Amen, say I." Luke appended my initials to the sentiment,
but as it was stronger than my inclinations
prompted me to endorse, I erased them. We visited also
the prison hospital where the Federals wounded at Manassas,
were being cared for. It was my first contact with
"grim visaged war."</p>

<p>To a stripling boy, reared in a quiet country home
and in a community in which there had never occurred
a serious personal difficulty, I had neither inherited nor
acquired any taste for carnage or bloodshed, and the
scene was not a pleasant one. And yet the battlefield
unfortunately soon dulls our natural sensibilities and begets
an indifference to suffering that would shock us in
civil life.</p>

<p>On reaching Monterey, Va., where the Oglethorpes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
were recuperating from the hardships of the "Laurel
Hill Retreat," we found every tent occupied and we
remained at the village inn until quarters could be provided.
I remember that I slept, or tried to sleep, on the
bare floor of our room as a sort of preparation for the
life on which I was entering. In this connection I recall
another fact, a peculiarity of this tavern, and that was
its capacity for the utilization of green apples as an article
of public diet. My experience with hostelries is not
claimed to be at all extensive, but among those whose
hospitality I have had the good or bad fortune to enjoy,
or endure, this particular inn, on the line named, certainly
"took the dilapidated linen from the lonely shrub."
We were treated to apples baked and stewed and fried,
to apple tarts and custards and dumplings, to apple butter
and it would probably be no exaggeration to say,
"there were others." After paying our bill Dan Mongin
remarked, "When green apple season plays out this hotel
is going to suspend." In verification of his prophecy,
when we passed through Monterey en route to join
Stonewall Jackson in December, its doors were closed, its
lights were gone and all its halls deserted. Whether its
demise was due to the green apple theory, I am unable
to say.</p>

<p>My first month in camp was devoid of incident, its monotony
being varied only by squad drill, guard duty, foraging
for maple syrup and other edibles among the
Dutch farmers of that section and digging graves for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the unfortunate victims of the campaign just ended. One
of the graves which the writer helped to dig in very hard
clay, was appropriated by a burial squad from another
regiment for one of their own dead. I am not lawyer
enough to say whether the act was petty larceny, forcible
entry and detainer, or what an old colored friend of
mine once diagnosed as "legal mischievous" with the
accent on the second syllable.</p>


<h3>MY FIRST MARCH.</h3>

<p>On Sept. 7, '61, Sterling Eve, Ginnie Hitt, Dan Mongin
and the writer, not having been favored with the
confidence of Gen. Lee as to his military plans, went into
the country on a foraging expedition. This trip was
probably inspired by a triumph in the culinary line
achieved by Dr. Hitt and George Pournelle in supplying
our table with two varieties of dumpling, apple and
huckleberry, on the same day. We had no bag, in which
to boil the dumpling and were forced to use the mess
towel as a substitute. How long it had been subjected
to its ordinary uses before being utilized in this way I do
not now recall. Dr. Hitt remembers, however, or says he
does, that the entire outer surface of the dumplings was
towel-marked. The nature of the mark referred to is left
without further discussion to the imagination of the
reader. In this connection I recall another incident in the
culinary line, which may be as well recorded here as
elsewhere. About twenty years after the war I met Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Hitt in Augusta and taking something from my pocket,
I handed it to him and asked if he could give me any
information as to its character. He examined it very
carefully by sight, touch and smell, and then said very
confidently: "Oh, yes, I know what that is. It is a stone
taken from a deer's liver." His diagnosis was not "reasonably"
correct. The article under examination was a
Confederate biscuit baked in our camp at Jacksonboro,
Tenn., in 1863, sent to my father's family as a specimen
and preserved during all those years. If I had taken the
precaution to have immersed it in insect powder it
would probably at this date have been still in the ring,
though possibly a little disfigured. A few years after Dr.
Hitt's examination, I found that it had&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like an insubstantial pageant faded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving not a wrack"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">but only a little dust behind.</p>

<p>On our return from the foraging tour with a good
supply of potatoes, onions and maple syrup, we found
the camp deserted&mdash;a camp favored with the purest
mountain air and the finest spring water, and yet where
Dan Mongin wrote to his father for brandy to counteract
the effects of malaria. The entire force at Monterey
had been ordered to report to Gen. Henry R. Jackson
on Green Brier River, and had broken camp two hours
before our arrival. After resting an hour we began
the tramp, trudging over the mountain roads for eight
miles in the mud and rain and stopping for the night at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the residence of a Col. Campbell in Crab Bottom. Here
we had the pleasure of meeting the first two heroines of
the war, Miss McLeod and Miss Kerr. They had ridden
seventy miles on horseback without an escort to notify
Gen. Garnett of McLellan's approach. My first day's
march, though a short one, had broken me down so
thoroughly that I was compelled to tax the kindness of
a 3rd Arkansas Regiment wagoner for a ride next day.
The entry in my journal for that date begins with these
words: "Took the road with a heavy heart and a heavier
load." Three years later, under the hardening process of
camp life I was enabled to march, on Hood's tramp to
Nashville and back to Corinth, Miss., twenty miles a day
continuously and rode only one of the eight hundred
miles covered in that campaign. During my two days
experience as an "Arkansas Traveler" I think I heard
more expletive, unadulterated "cussin" from the driver
of that wagon than it has ever been my misfortune to listen
to. His capacity in this line seemed to be not only
double barreled, but of the magazine gun variety. If he
had failed to pass his examination in the school of
profanity I have never seen a man who was entitled to
a diploma. I appreciated the ride, but was glad to reach
our new camp, since it relieved me of his presence.</p>


<h3>MY FIRST SKIRMISH.</h3>

<p>Gen. Jackson's force on the Green Brier consisted of
the 1st and 12th Ga., the 3rd Ark. and the 23rd and 37th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Va. Regiments. Ten or twelve miles northwest of us, on
Cheat Mountain, lay a Federal force of 5,000 men under
Gen. Reynolds. Gen. Lee had planned an attack to be
made on this force on the morning of Sept. 12th, two
days after our arrival at the Green Brier. On the evening
of the 11th an advance guard of ninety men from
the 1st and 12th Ga. under command of Lieut. Dawson
was formed with instructions to flank, by a night march,
the Federal picket, secure a position in their rear, capture
them and thus prevent notice to Gen. Reynolds of
the intended attack. For this guard there were detailed
from the Oglethorpes, Wilberforce Daniel, Joe Derry,
Tom Burgess, W. H. Clark and the writer. Leaving
camp at 7:30 p. m., under the pilotage of a citizen of
that section we reached a position within half a mile of
the Federal camp about sunrise, after a fatiguing march
in the rain and mud, being compelled to draw ourselves
up the slippery mountain side by the undergrowth that
lay in our route. Soon after reaching our place of ambush
we heard the drums beat for "Guard Mount" and
then the bands began to play "Annie Laurie," "Run,
Nigger Run," and "Jordan is a Hard Road to Trabble,"
were three of the selections rendered. The first suggested
pleasant memories of our far away homes; the second,
the possibility that in a little while there might be a
practical illustration of the refrain, while the tramp we
had just taken satisfied us that "Jordan" was not the
only hard road to travel. The selection of these airs re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>calls
the singular fact that in actual service military
bands do not as a rule play national or military music.
The writer had other opportunities than the one named
of hearing Federal bands during his term of service, but
does not recall a single instance in which a national air
was rendered. Lulled by the music and overcome by
fatigue and loss of sleep, I fell into a doze, from which I
was awakened by the accidental discharge of a gun in
the hands of one of the guard. A Federal sergeant from
the picket post, hearing the noise, came down the road
to investigate. On reaching a point opposite the left of
our line he heard the ominous click of the rifle hammers
and started in full run for his camp. Six or eight balls
crashed through him and the poor fellow fell dead in the
road. Attracted by the firing, about twenty-five of the
Federal pickets came hurriedly down the road and on
seeing their dead comrade fired a volley into the woods,
which concealed us, but failed to do any execution.
"Charge!" sang out our commander, and we broke for
the road. Before reaching it, the pickets had scattered
into the woods beyond. Tom Burgess, as he leaped into
the road saw one of them rise from a stump behind
which he had been hiding, and run. Tom raised his rifle,
took deliberate aim and fired. As he fell, Tom pointed
his finger at him and said, "Got you." I was standing
only a few feet from Tom and it has always been a matter
of gratification to me that my gun had been fired
before reaching the road and that I had no opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to reload. At such close range it would have been almost
impossible to have missed my man, and whatever my
feeling at the time may have been it would have been a
source of life-long regret to me to know positively that
"some mother's boy" had fallen by my hand, even in
war. Several others were killed as they ran through the
woods. No member of the guard received even a scratch,
and the affair had more the appearance of a rabbit hunt
than a skirmish. After the firing had ceased, Lieut. Dawson,
feeling that it was unsafe to remain so near the Federal
camp with so small a force, reformed the guard and
we began our march down the mountain. We were expecting
to meet the reserve picket of the enemy and in
a sharp curve in the road were confronted by a column
of troops marching in fours and only a hundred yards
away. One of the guard sang out, "Here they are boys,"
and the firing began. Three men were shot down and
seeing that we were outnumbered, Dawson gave the
command: "Fall below the road." Believing that implicit
obedience to orders was the first requisite of a soldier, I
responded with considerable promptness. The fire slackened
a moment and then came the order: "Charge 'em."
Up into the road we clambered again, when we discovered
that we were fighting our own regiment, and "Cease
firing, we are Georgians," rang out from nearly a hundred
throats. Ed Johnson, then in command of the 12th
Ga., afterwards a Major General, was riding towards the
head of the column and hearing our cry, sang out: "They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
are liars, boys. Pop it to 'em! Pop it to 'em." The mistake
was soon discovered, however, and the firing ceased.
Three men had been killed and a number wounded by
this mutual and unfortunate error. After the skirmish
had ended and order had been restored, Dr. Hitt told
me that he had drawn a bead, squirrel or otherwise, on
my anatomy, and was in the act of firing when Col. Ed
Johnson, in his anxiety to reach the front, rode directly
between us and possibly saved him the horror of having
killed a comrade and messmate. One of the victims of
that encounter, Felder, of the Houston Guards, told his
mess on leaving camp that he would be killed, a presentiment
that was unfortunately too true. Another poor fellow
was shot through the thigh, the ball cutting an artery.
He lay there until the blood ran down the road for a
distance of fifteen feet. The sight caused another soldier
to have a nervous chill and he begged piteously to be
moved away.</p>

<p>After the wounded had been cared for, the guard was
reformed in front of the brigade and we were marched
back to a position in front of the Federal camp to await
the attack on its rear by the 3rd Ark. and the 23rd Va.
Why this attack was never made seems to be a sort of
unsolved problem. Gen. Lee is said to have made a verbal
explanation to President Davis, but if there has
been any published statement of the reason I have failed
to see it. As the attack on the rear had for some reason
failed to materialize, Gen. Jackson, after remaining on
the mountain for four days, returned to his old camp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with this, my first skirmish I am glad
to have the opportunity of paying deserved tribute to a
comrade, who has since passed over the river, but who,
on that day, as on every other in which I had the honor
to serve with him in time of peril, was conspicuous for
his courage and his cool indifference to danger. When
the order was given to fall below the road in order to
secure some protection from the rocks and trees, Will
Daniel refused to do so and kept his exposed position,
coolly loading and firing until the skirmish was over.
In devotion to the cause, for which he fought, in readiness
to accept the gravest personal risks, in apparently
absolute unconsciousness of danger, he was every inch
a soldier.</p>

<p>And now what were my own sensations in this, my
first baptism of fire? A candid confession is said to be
good for the soul, but whether it would be good for the
reputation in this particular case is another matter. Under
the law of testimony a witness is not compelled to
incriminate himself. Besides, after the lapse of nearly
forty years, my memory can not be expected to retain
very accurately such minor details. I will only say, therefore,
that while the excitement produced by the crack of
the rifles and the hiss of the minies did in some degree
lessen the sense of personal danger, I have been able,
even in my limited experience as a traveler, to find quite
a number of places that were to me equally as pleasant
as being under fire even for the first time. I speak, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
course, only for myself. Men's tastes differ in this as
widely perhaps as in other matters, and I do not claim
that mine was a universal or even a common experience.
I only claim that while I had been curious to know how
I would feel under such circumstances, my curiosity was
satisfied in a little while, in a very little while. This may
have been due to the fact that my temperament is conservative
and that I did not care to be an extremist even
in a little matter of this kind&mdash;possibly, ah, yes, possibly.</p>


<h3>MY FIRST PICKET DUTY.</h3>

<p>For several miles in our front, the road leading towards
Cheat Mountain ran through a narrow valley and
then crossing the river, wound up the mountain side. On
an outpost near this road my first picket service was rendered.
From an aesthetic, rather than a military point
of view the scenery from this post was really enchanting.
Just beyond the river lay a range of mountains
broken in its contour by a partial gap. In its rear and
forming a background, rose a loftier range, the whole
constituting in appearance a mammoth alcove. The foliage
of the forest growth, that studded the slopes from
base to summit, alchemized by the autumn frosts had
changed its hues to gold and crimson and with its blended
tints forming to the eye an immense bouquet, the picture
was worthy an artist's brush and has lingered in
my memory during all these years. But the scene
changes. Night comes on cold and drizzly and starless.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>No fire is allowed by the officer of the guard. Standing
alone on an outpost in Egyptian darkness and numbed
with cold, while the muffled patter of the rain drops on
the fallen leaves continually suggests the stealthy footfall
of an approaching foe, I reach the conclusion that
it subjects a man to some inconvenience to die for his
country.</p>

<p>A few nights afterwards the picket at this post was
attacked by the enemy and driven in. As they retired under
fire Joe Derry was knocked down by a buck and ball
cartridge that riddled his cap and grazed his scalp but
inflicted no wound. When they had rallied on the reserve
post and Joe had opportunity to take his bearings he
found that while unwilling to remain and extend to his
Northern friends any social courtesies, he had been
kind enough to leave with them a lock of his hair. The
clipping was made without pecuniary charge, but Joe
has probably preferred since to patronize a professional
barber even at the expense of his bank account.</p>


<h3>MY FIRST BATTLE.</h3>

<p>On Oct. 3rd, '61, Gen. Reynolds, thinking, possibly,
that military etiquette required that he should return the
call we had made him on Sept. 12th, came down, attended
by his entire force and knocked at the door of our
outer picket posts in the early morning hours with the
evident purpose of making an informal visit to our camp.
The knock was loud enough to arouse Col. Ed. Johnson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
who went out and took command of the pickets in person
in order that the reception given our visitors might
be sufficiently warm and cordial. Under his personal
direction every foot of the Federal advance was stubbornly
contested. A little fellow belonging to our regiment
finally grew tired of falling back and running up
to Johnson said: "Colonel, let's charge 'em." Johnson,
with that peculiar nervous twitching of the lip that characterized
him in battle, commended the little fellow for
his grit, but did not think it good military judgment to
charge an entire army of five thousand men with a
squad of fifty pickets. By 8 a. m. Gen. Reynolds had
taken position in our front and his artillery had opened
on our line. The main attack was expected on our right,
and to its defence the 1st and 12th Ga. were assigned.
Forming into line and lying down to escape the shot
and shells from the Federal batteries, we awaited the
attack. A nervous officer in the regiment kept walking
up and down the line saying: "Keep cool, boys, keep
cool," until Lieut. Ben Simmons of the Oglethorpes,
suggested to him that he was wasting his breath, that
the boys were cool. Gen. Jackson came down to our
position to overlook the field, and while there a courier
rode up and said: "General, the wagoners are cutting the
traces and running off with the horses." The General
grew very much excited and turning to his son, Harry
Jackson, said, "Go up there, Henry and shoot the first
wagoner that cuts a trace or leaves his team." Harry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
galloped off, trying to get his pistol from the holster.
After the cannonade had lasted several hours an infantry
attack was made on our left and was repulsed. Then
Gen. Reynolds ordered an assault on our right. As the
attacking column debouched from the woods on the further
bank of the shallow Green Brier, we were double-quicked
to the front to oppose their passage. Just then
Shoemaker's Va. Battery began to throw grape shot into
their ranks and the men refused to cross. The officers
stormed at them and rode their horses into the ranks in
the effort to force them to advance, but without avail.
The column fell back to the road where they were joined
by their right wing and by 1 p. m. the entire force was
making tracks for Cheat Mountain. Thus ended my second
lesson in "Jomini," or my first battle, if battle it
can be called. The losses on both sides, probably, did
not aggregate two hundred. The official report of the
engagement was, however, so elaborate that it was subjected
to criticism and ridicule by the merciless pen of
Jno. M. Daniel, of the Richmond Examiner. It was reported
that he said that there were more casualties from
overwork and exhaustion in setting up type for that report
than from shot and shell in the battle.</p>

<p>Among the wounded that day was a member of the
Bainbridge company of our regiment, who had been
shot down in the early morning as the pickets were retiring
before the Federal advance and, whose comrades
were forced to leave him where he fell. As the Union<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
troops passed him again on their return a surgeon was
asked as to the propriety of taking him along as a prisoner.
"No," said he. "Give him a canteen of water. He'll
be dead in a few hours." The wounded man looked up at
him and quoting, as Dr. McIntyre would say, very liberally
from profane history, told him that he didn't intend
to die. They left him, nevertheless, and when, at 3
o'clock next morning, he was brought into camp, both
of our surgeons pronounced his wound fatal. He dissented
very strongly from their opinions, was sent to the
hospital and came out a well man, saved largely, as I
believe, by his dogged determination not to die.</p>


<h3>A NIGHT STAMPEDE.</h3>

<p>There are panics commercial and panics military,
bearing no special relation to each other and yet produced
possibly by similar causes. One is attributed to a
lack of confidence in others; the other is possibly due
to a want of the same mental condition in regard to ourselves.
In war fear as well as courage is contagious. The
conspicuous bravery of a single soldier has sometimes
steadied a wavering line, while one man's inability to face
the music has begun a rearward movement that ended
in a rout. Gen. Dick Taylor says that in Jackson's Valley
Campaign he one day quieted the nervousness of his
men under a heavy fire by standing on the breastworks
and coolly striking a match on the heel of his boot to
light a cigar. His apparent indifference to the danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was probably feigned but it produced the desired result.
Heroism in battle and out of it is probably not so much
the result of what is termed personal courage as it is the
effect of lofty pride of character, backed and strengthened
by a God-like sense of duty. Napoleon once ordered
one of his colonels to charge a battery that was playing
havoc with his lines. The officer turned pale as the order
came from his commander's lips, but he went to his post
promptly and led the charge and Napoleon said to his
staff: "That's a brave man, he feels the danger, but is
willing to face it." There are times, however, in war,
when men, from some cause, real or imaginary, lose
their self-control and give way to an unreasonable and
unreasoning fear, when the instinct of self-preservation
is uppermost and patriotism and pride alike lose their
power. A few occasions of this kind I recall in my term
of service. One of them occurred on the night of Oct.
26, '61, at Green Brier River. A picket from one of the
outposts came in and reported the presence of a body of
Federal troops near his post. Two companies from the
1st and 12th Ga. and 37th Va. each, were aroused from
sleep and sent out to capture or disperse these disturbers
of our dreams. Few occasions in war test a man's nerves
more thoroughly than being suddenly awakened at night
by an alarm. I have known men at such a time to suffer
from nervous chills and on one occasion it brought on a
member of the regiment an attack of cholera morbus.
As this was the only instance within my observation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
when such a result was produced, I am not prepared,
without further evidence, to recommend it to the medical
profession either as an emetic or an aperient.</p>

<p>The six companies, including the Oglethorpes, had
passed the last vidette post and crossing Green Brier
River had begun the ascent of the mountain beyond.
We had reached the point where the enemy had been
seen and the location was an ideal one for an ambuscade.
The dense forest growth overarching the road, shut out
the starlight and we were unable to see six feet in our
front. The head of the column had passed a sharp bend
in the road and was doubling back, after the manner
of mountain highways, when a soldier near the front
stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snapping
sound resembling the click of a rifle hammer. Some one
in his rear, not knowing that the column had changed
direction, and mistaking the sound for evidence of an
ambush, said: "Look out boys," and stepped to the side
of the road. The next file followed suit and the movement
increased in volume and force as it came down the
line, until the hurried tramp of feet sounded like a cavalry
charge, as most of the men thought it was. For a
few minutes everything was in confusion and panic
reigned supreme. There was an undefined dread in every
man's mind of a danger whose character and extent was
hidden by the darkness. Several guns were fired, but
fortunately there were no casualties save a few skinned
noses from too sudden contact with the undergrowth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that walled in the road. Order was finally restored and
the command proceeded on its mission, but failed to
locate an enemy, which had probably never existed except
in the perverted vision of a nervous picket.</p>


<h3>THREE LITTLE CONFEDERATES.</h3>

<p>Thomas Nelson Page has written very charmingly of
"Two Little Confederates," but an incident that occurred
during our stay at Green Brier shows that "there were
others." On Nov. 14, '61, three Virginia boys living in
vicinity of our camp, and all under fifteen years of age,
were out squirrel hunting on the Green Bank road,
which led partly in the direction of the Federal camp on
Cheat Mountain. Rambling through the woods in search
of game, they came in sight of Yankee soldier, who was
out on a similar errand, or possibly on an independent
scouting expedition. As he was a "stranger" they decided
to "take him in." He had laid aside his gun and cartridge
box and was sitting by a tree eating his lunch. Slipping
up noiselessly in his rear they captured his arms and
then presenting their squirrel rifles they offered to serve
as an honorary escort to our camp. He was rather loth to
comply with the request of his youthful captors, but the
muzzles of their guns were very persuasive, and with true
Virginia pluck, they marched their mortified prisoner to
Gen. Jackson's quarters. I regret that I failed to preserve
the names of those three brave little Confederates.</p>

<p>But few other incidents worthy of record in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
memories occurred during our stay on the Green Brier.
On Nov. 17 there was a hotly contested snow ball fight
between the 1st and 12th Ga. Regiments, resulting in a
drawn battle. Two days later at 2 a. m., in response to
the rattle of musketry at the picket post, we were aroused
and marshalled into line in the wintry night air to
repel an expected attack on our camp. It was on this
occasion that the cholera morbus incident, to which
allusion has been made, occurred. The alarm proved
groundless, as the pickets had mistaken an old grey
mare and her colt for a body of the enemy. As the animal
was clothed in grey, the Confederate color, the mistake
was all the less excusable.</p>

<h3>A CHANGE OF BASE.</h3>


<p>For some weeks rumors, or "grape vine" bulletins, as
they were called, had been afloat in camp that our regiment
was to be transferred to coast service. To boys
reared in the milder climate of Georgia the taste we were
having of a Virginia winter rendered these rumors very
palatable. And when, on Nov. 21, orders came to break
camp we felt rather confident that we were bidding a
long farewell to "Traveler's Repose" and Northwest
Virginia, and were off for Georgia. The baggage wagons,
of which the 1st Ga. had at that stage of the war,
enough, in Gen. Loring's opinion, to equip a division,
were loaded and went their way. All the afternoon we
lay around the dismantled camp awaiting order to "follow
pursuit," as a friend of mine once said, but they failed
to come. Night settled down cold and cheerless, with
our tents and blankets ten miles away, and we had to
make the best of it. My bedfellow and I slept on an
oilcloth, covered with an overcoat, and tied our four
feet up together in a flannel shirt. Next day we crossed
Allegheny Mountain and after three days' march, buoyed
with the hope of spending the winter under a warmer
sun, we reluctantly turned our faces Northward again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with the feeling in our hearts if not voiced upon our
lips,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, ever thus from childhood's hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen my fondest hopes decay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a week's march my feet grew very sore and as
I limped through Harrisonburg, a sweet-faced Virginia
matron, with music in her voice and the light of heaven
in her eye, beckoned to me from the window where she
was sitting and gave me a nice pair of woollen socks.
Passing through Newtown, Middletown, Kernstown and
a number of other towns in a section made famous afterwards
by Jackson's Valley Campaign, we reached
Winchester Dec. 8, 1861. A few days later a supply of
blankets contributed by the good ladies of Augusta, was
received by the Oglethorpes. One of the contributors
had no blankets, and in lieu of them, donated a handsome
crumb-cloth, which like Joseph's coat, was of
many colors, red and green being the prevailing tints.
In the distribution this fell to Elmore Dunbar, the wag
of the Company. Not needing it as a blanket he took it
to a tailor in Winchester, had it transformed into a full
suit, cap, coat and pants, and donning it had an innumerable
company of gamins, white and black, following
in his wake all over the town.</p>

<p>He and Harrison Foster were messmates. There was
no discount on either of them as soldiers. Enlisting at
the first call to arms, they were always among the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to toe the line at every beat of the longroll and in the
closing months of the war, when hope of success had
well nigh passed and so many were dropping by the
wayside, they held out bravely and manfully to the end.
But as cooks they were not a brilliant success. One evening
Harrison had gathered a few brush to make a fire,
when he called on Dunbar to assist in his preparations
for the evening meal, an appeal, to which the latter failed
to respond. "Well," said Harrison, "if you don't help, I'll
swear I won't cook any supper." "All right," said
Dunbar, "My supper's cooked," and fishing out of
his coattail pocket an antiquated biscuit of uncertain
age, he began to nibble. "Well," said Harrison, "I won't
build any fire. You'll have to freeze," and Dunbar gently
drew from his haversack an old-fashioned silk
beaver hat, that he had worn in the march up the valley
and quietly placed it on the fire as his contribution to the
evening's comfort.</p>


<h3>A SOLILOQUY&mdash;(NOT HAMLET'S.)</h3>

<p>Among the original members enlisting with the Oglethorpes,
was one H&mdash; H&mdash;, who, in civil life, was so
scrupulously careful with his dress that in these latter
days he would have passed a creditable examination as
a dude. Camp life is not specially conducive to personal
neatness and eight month's service had left to him on
this line only the memory of better days. Returning from
Winchester one night in a condition not promotive of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
mental equilibrium, he failed to find his tent and spent
the night around the camp fire. He awoke next morning
with his head in a camp kettle and his clothing soiled
and blackened by contact with the cooking utensils, that
had been his only bed-fellows. Running his hand
through his matted locks and surveying his discolored
uniform he was overheard to indulge in the following
soliloquy: "Is this the gay and fascinating H&mdash; H&mdash;, that
once perambulated the streets of Augusta in faultless
attire? When I think of what I am and what I used to
was, I feel myself blamed badly treated without sufficient
cause."</p>


<h3>"LIABLE TO DISAPPINTMENTS."</h3>

<p>On a Saturday afternoon in my boyhood days, in company
with a schoolmate, I was rambling through the
woods in the enjoyment of the hebdomadal relief from
the restraints of the school room and the unpalatable
mysteries of the three R's taught with a hickory attachment.
Reaching a country bathinghouse half-filled with
water and used by a neighboring colored Baptist church
for baptismal purposes, we proceeded to draw off the
water in order to catch the tadpoles that were enjoying
their otium cum dignitate on its mud-lined bottom. On
the next day the preacher and congregation assembled
at the place to administer the rite of baptism to a number
of applicants for membership. Owing to our tadpole
hunt of the preceding day, they found that unlike the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
place mentioned in the Scriptures, there was not "much
water there," and they were compelled to defer the ceremony
to a more convenient season. In dismissing the
congregation the colored brother took occasion to remark
that "We are liable, brethren, to disappintments
in this life." On Christmas day in '61, in our camp, near
Winchester, the mess to which the writer belonged
found sad occasion to verify the truth if not the orthography
of our dusky brother's observation. With a laudable
desire to celebrate the day in appropriate style we
had arranged with a colored caterer to supply our mess
table with the proverbial turkey and such other adjuncts
as the depleted condition of our financial bureau would
permit. The day dawned and in the early morning hours
our appetites for the coming feast were whetted by an
eggnog kindly furnished the entire company by Lieut.
J. V. H. Allen. The Christmas sun passed its meridian
and traveled on toward its setting with no Joshua to
stay its course. The appointed dinner hour came, as all
appointed times do, but the proverbial turkey came not,
with adjuncts or without. With our gastronomic hopes
knocked finally into pi, but not mince pie, we sat down
at last to our hardtack and bacon, lamenting in our hearts
the uncertainty of "aught that wades, or soars, or shines
beneath the stars." Whether the roost, from which our
caterer expected to supply our larder was too well guarded
on the preceding night, or whether the rating given
our mess by the commercial agencies was unsatisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
has remained through all these years an unsolved problem.</p>


<h3>A TRAMP WITH STONEWALL JACKSON.</h3>

<p>After our arrival in Winchester the "grape vine" service
was again brought into requisition and rumors were
current that we were going into winter quarters. But this
was not "Stonewall Jackson's Way." His headquarters
were in Winchester. Bath and Romney, in his department,
were occupied by Federal troops and he determined
to oust them. On Jan. 1, '62, our division, with
Ashby's cavalry, began the march to Bath. It was a
bright, warm day, with a touch of spring in the air. On
the evening of the 3rd it began to snow and for thirty-one
days the sun did not show his face again. If any
reader of these memories should be disposed to question
the accuracy of this statement, I can only say that it
is so written in the chronicles of the First Georgia Regiment
as recorded in my journal for the month named.
That evening the wagons failed to reach our camp
and our supper was confined to a single course&mdash;parched
corn. Not relishing a repetition of the menu for breakfast,
I dropped out of the ranks soon after the march
began and tramping across the freshly fallen snow to a
residence not far from the roadside, I found a trio of
pretty Virginia girls engineering the first cooking stove
I had ever seen. Reared in a country home and accustomed
to rely for my daily bread on the culinary skill of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
old "Aunt Hannah," the presiding genius of an old-fashioned
kitchen fire place six feet wide, where, with
the tact born of long experience, she piled the ruddy
coals on the biscuit oven lid, or fried in a skillet the
home-made sausage and spare rib with home made lard,
or broiled on a gridiron the juicy beefsteak, or piled the
burning "chunks" under the mammoth kettle that hung
from the crane, while from its cavernous depths the air
was laden with the aroma of ham and cabbage, this innovation
on old-time methods was something of a revelation.
But its novelty did not diminish the relish with
which I hid away in my empty anatomy the steaming
pan cakes dished out by fair and shapely hands to a
squad of hungry soldier, one of whom, as Bill Arp would
say, I was glad to be which.</p>

<p>On the morning of Jan. 4th we were halted in front of
Bath, while a portion of the division was deployed on the
left of the road for an attack upon the enemy. As the
line of battle advanced through the snow, over a mountain
ridge, and in plain view of us, Capt. Sam Crump,
who had seen service in Mexico, said: "Well, boys, the
ball will open now in fifteen minutes." I was only a
stripling boy, with but limited experience as a soldier,
and I remember with what reverent respect and implicit
faith I received the utterance. But the ball did not
open. The Federals retired without resistance to Hancock,
Md., six miles away, and we hurried forward in
pursuit. Reaching the hills overlooking the Potomac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and the town after dark, we were standing in the road
awaiting orders when a sudden flash illuminated the
heavens and the regiment sank as one man into the
snow. We thought we had struck a masked battery, but
it was our own guns throwing grape shot into the
woods in front. After standing an hour or two in the
snow without fire we bivouacked and I slept, or tried to
sleep, on three rails with their ends resting on a stump.
We had built a fire of rails, a favorite army fuel in those
days. I do not remember from what species of timber
they were made, but I do recall the fact that it was a
popping variety when subjected to heat. All through the
night our sleep was disturbed by the necessity of rising
at frequent intervals to extinguish our burning blankets,
and one man had his cap nearly burned from his head
before it awoke him.</p>

<p>Next morning Turner Ashby went over under flag of
truce to demand the surrender of the town. During his
absence on this mission it was rumored that he had been
held as a prisoner and his cavalry were preparing to
storm the town to secure his release. The report proved
a fake and he returned, bringing Gen. Lander's refusal
to comply. An artillery duel ensued. The Federal guns
had to be elevated to reach our position and their balls
striking the frozen ground would rebound. Some of the
boys, who had played "town ball" at school would pretend
to catch them, and would sing out: "Caught him
out," when another would reply: "Don't count, 'twas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
second bounce." It seemed more like a frolic than a
fight. That night I laid aside my shoes and found them
next morning filled with snow, while my blanket was
covered with an inch or two of the same white mantle.
Water was scarce and I tried to secure enough for a cup
of coffee by melting snow in a tin cup, but found it a
tedious process.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th the force was withdrawn
to operate against Romney. The weather at this time recalls
an old rhyme learned in my boyhood, which fits the
case better than any description I could give and which
runs thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First she blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she snew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she thew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then she friz."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The roads were as slick as glass. The horses had to be
rough-shod and the wheels rough-locked with chains to
cut the frozen sleet and snow in descending the hills, and
even with these precautions the horses would fall and be
dragged to the bottom of the descent before a halt could
be made. Twelve horses would be hitched to a single
piece of artillery and details were made from each company
to push the wagons up the hills. To men not inured
to such hardships the experience was a pretty rough one
and the criticisms of the winter campaign made by some
of them would not look well in a Sunday school book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Osborne Stone's Presbyterian training would not allow
him to use any cuss words, but I remember that his
"dog-on-its" were frequent and emphatic. On January
8 we reached the "Cross Roads," and those who were
pronounced by the surgeons unfit for further winter service
were returned to Winchester. With them went the
writer, to worry for four weeks with typhoid fever, while
the command went on to Romney. Of the Romney trip
I can not speak from personal knowledge, but from the
accounts given by those who can, it was a repetition of
the return from Hancock with its hardships, perhaps
intensified.</p>

<p>Jackson accomplished his purpose, to drive the enemy
from his department, though at the expense of a good
deal of exposure and suffering to his men.</p>


<h3>ASHBY AND JACKSON.</h3>

<p>As hard as the service was, I am glad to have had the
opportunity of sharing it with such a man as Turner
Ashby. He was then a colonel of cavalry. Mounted on
his milk white steed, with the form of an athlete; coal
black hair, a silky brown beard reaching nearly to his
waist and a velvety, steel-grey eye, he was, in soul as
well as body, an ideal cavalier. His command embraced
some of the best blood of Virginia and he and they were
fit types of the Old South, worthy representatives of a
civilization, that in culture, courtesy and courage, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
honor and in honesty, the past had never equalled and
the future will never repeat.</p>

<p>Jackson had not then developed the military genius
that afterwards rendered him so famous. The campaign
furnished but little field for generalship, but it gave evidence
of one trait in his character&mdash;to halt at no obstacle
in the accomplishment of a purpose to benefit the cause
for which he fought. In personal appearance and bearing
he and Ashby differed widely. Without grace as a rider,
and indifferently mounted, there was nothing in his appearance
to indicate or foreshadow the height to which
he afterwards attained. And yet I can but cherish with
pride the recollection that in this campaign I had the
privilege of serving under one, who in the blood-stained
years that followed "went down to a soldier's grave with
the love of the whole world, and the name of Stonewall
Jackson."</p>


<h3>"AUNT HANNAH."</h3>

<p>In this connection my heart prompts me to pay its
earnest tribute to one, whose memory the sketch above
recalls. Dear old Aunt Hannah. How her name brings
back to my heart and life today the glamour of the old,
old days, that will never come again&mdash;days when to me
a barefoot boy, life seemed a long and happy holiday. I
can see her now, her head crowned with a checkered
handkerchief, her arms bared to the elbows, her spectacles
set primly on her nose, while from her kindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
eyes there shone the light of a pure white soul within.
She was only an humble slave, and yet her love for me
was scarcely less than that my father and mother bore
me and when on a summer's day in '61 my brother and
myself left the old homestead to take our humble places
under a new born flag, there was not a dry eye on the
whole plantation and old Aunt Hannah wept in grief as
pure and deep as if the clods were falling on an only
child.</p>

<p>Long years have come and gone since she was laid
away in the narrow house appointed for all the living.
No marble headstone marks the spot, yet I am sure the
humble mound that lies above her sleeping dust, covers
a heart as honest and as faithful, as patient and as gentle,
as kindly and as true as any that rest beneath the proudest
monument that art could fashion, or affection buy.
She reared a large family of sons and daughters, Rev.
Charles T. Walker, the "Black Spurgeon," among them,
transmitting to them all a character for honesty and virtue
marked even in those, the better days of the republic.</p>

<p>Wisely or otherwisely, in the order of Providence, or in
the order of Napoleon's "heavier battalions," we have
in this good year of our Lord not only a New South, but
a new type of Aunt Hannah. The old is, I fear, a lost
Pleiad, whose light will shine no more on land, or sea,
or sky.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h3>A RIDE WITH BELLE BOYD, THE CONFEDERATE SPY.</h3>

<p>On a page of the writer's scrap book, underneath a
roll of the Oglethorpes and in friendly contact with the
parole granted me at Johnston's surrender, is a slip of
paper pocket-worn, and yellow with age, which reads as
follows: "Winchester, Va., Mar. 1, 1862. Pass W. A.
Clark and brother today on Valley Road. By order Maj.
Gen. T. J. Jackson. M. M. Sibert, Captain and Provost
Marshall." Thereby hangs the following tale: On my
return to Winchester, after the tramp to Hancock, I had
secured lodgings at the home of a Mrs. Polk, where for
nearly four weeks, I lay with my pulses throbbing with
fever. From that sick bed two incidents come back vividly
today over the waste of years that have intervened.
My hostess, whose kindness I shall never forget, had a
daughter, Nellie, who, as a rustic friend of mine would
say, was something of a "musicianer." Patriotic songs
were all the rage and one evening as I lay on my bed
restless from fever and trying to sleep, she began in the
parlor below to sing the "Bonnie Blue Flag." The copy
used had, I think, eleven verses, and in my nervous condition
the entertainment seemed endless. Just as I had
congratulated myself on its conclusion, a young gentleman
called and insisted on a repetition of the program
with his vocal accompaniment, and she was kind enough
to comply, without skipping a verse. I can not recall a
musical entertainment that my condition forced me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
appreciate less though cheerfully acquitting her of any
malice aforethought in the matter.</p>

<p>As I lay on my bed during all those weeks and looked
on the white-mantled hills that environed the town I
remember distinctly how intensely my parched lips
craved the cooling touch of the pure white snow. But
like Tantalus, I was forced day after day to gaze on a
luxury I could not enjoy, for the medical science of that
day said nay. Tempora mutantur, and doctors change
with them.</p>

<p>Before I had recovered sufficiently to leave my bed
Stonewall Jackson decided to evacuate Winchester and
ordered all the convalescent sick to be moved. Having
no desire to complete my recovery in a Federal prison
my brother secured the pass above referred to and seats
in the hack to Strasburg. There were nine passengers
and among them was Belle Boyd, the Confederate Spy.
Her home was in Martinsburg and her father a Major
in the Confederate army. Her mother had forced her to leave
home on the approach of the Federal army. On its
first visit to Martinsburg she had remained there. Having
a soldier friend in the hospital and uncertain as to
the treatment he would receive from the enemy, she had
taken two of her father's servants to the hospital with a
stretcher, had him placed upon it and walked by his side
through the streets to her home with a loaded pistol in
her hand to protect him from insult or injury at their
hands. A few days later a Federal soldier attempted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
place a Union flag over the door of her home and she
persuaded him to desist by the use of a leaden argument
from her pistol. Another attempt to remove a Confederate
flag that waved over the mantel in her parlor met
with a similar counter-irritant, and she was molested no
further. Fortunately or unfortunately as the case may
be, neither of her shots hit their mark. In view of these
facts her mother thought it prudent to send her away
before the Union forces occupied the town again, and she
was en route to the home of a relative in Front Royal.
To protect myself from the chilly air during the stage
ride I was wearing a woollen visor knitted for my brother
by Miss Lucy Meredith, of Winchester, and covering
my head and throat, leaving only my eyes exposed. With
a woman's instinct she saw that I was too weak to sit
up and arranged to give me possession of an entire seat,
improvised a pillow of a red scarf she was wearing on
her shoulders and in every way possible contributed to
my ease and comfort. On reaching Strasburg she aided
my brother in getting me into the hotel, arranged a
lounge in the parlor for me, brought my supper and entertained
me during the meal, refusing to eat anything
herself until I had finished. After supper she sat by me
and talked to me for an hour, and then, thinking I was
weary, she moved the lamp in a corner of the room
shading it from my eyes with her scarf, so that I might
sleep. After all these years my memory retains some incidents
of that conversation. I remember that she told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
me something of her child life; that when a little girl
she had been a member of Dave Strother's party in his
tour through Virginia, which he described so charmingly
in the early numbers of Harper's Magazine over the
nom de plume of "Porte Crayon;" that Gen. Lander,
who commanded the Federal troops, that we had driven
from Bath into Maryland, was an old sweetheart of hers;
that Dave Strother was a member of his staff, and she
intended to cut his acquaintance.</p>

<p>I remember that she said further that she had
been hurt by a remark made to her that day
by a soldier about the seeming boldness of Virginia girls;
that soldiers mistook kindness and the expression of a
desire to serve them for boldness; that she intended
coming to Georgia after the war to get married. She left
on the next train for her destination, and I saw her no
more. She had impressed me as one of kindest and gentlest
of women and yet a year or two later she forded the
Potomac alone in a storm at midnight to carry important
information to her brother in Stuart's cavalry. Perhaps
with woman as well as man</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bravest are the tenderest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loving are the daring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If necessity had required it I believe she would have
led the charge of Pickett's Division at Gettysburg without
a tremor.</p>

<p>In the years that followed she became a noted spy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
going into the Federal lines and securing information,
which she sent or carried to the Confederate army. She
was finally arrested and sent to Washington as a prisoner.
It was reported that she married the Federal officer, to
whose oversight she had been entrusted and that he
joined the Confederate army. Some of her methods as
a spy subjected her to harsh and hostile criticism, but in
grateful memory of her kindness to one, who was only a
private soldier, without rank or social prestige, one who
had no claim upon her service save that in an humble
way he had tried to serve the cause she loved and in that
service had grown sick and helpless, her name has never
passed my lips except in tones of fervent gratitude and
reverent respect.</p>


<h3>VIRGINIA.</h3>

<p>As my service as a soldier on Virginia soil was now
about to end and as that service carried me afterwards
into six other states of the Confederacy, in four of them
lengthening into months or years, it may not be amiss
to say in this connection that judged by that experience,
Virginia stood above them all in kindly feeling and hospitable
treatment to the Confederate soldier. Furnishing
to the army perhaps a larger quota of her sons than
any other State, her territory tracked by the tread of hostile
armies for four bloody years, her homes destroyed
and her fields laid waste, her generous kindness and her
active sympathy for the suffering soldier never wavered
to the end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>While the South as a whole gave to the world the
highest type of civilization it had ever known, Virginia,
as I believe, stood at its head, the capstone in the fairest
structure the sun has gilded since the morning stars
sang together, and garlanding its summit like a glistening
coronal, bright with the light of immortality stands
the name and fame of Robert Edward Lee.</p>


<h3>HOME AGAIN.</h3>

<p>The 1st Ga. Regiment was the only infantry organization
from this State mustered out at the expiration of its
first year's service. The Conscript Act became effective
in the spring of '62, and succeeding regiments, whose
terms expired later were under its provision retained in
the service. On the return of the command from Romney
the 1st Ga. was ordered to Tennessee. Going by rail
to Lynchburg, a railroad accident occasioned some delay
at that point and as their time would have expired in
a few days they were sent to Augusta to be mustered
out.</p>

<p>My brother, knowing that I would not be strong
enough to rejoin the command before its term of service
ended, decided to take me directly home. And so by
stage and rail, with tiresome delays at every junction,
in the deepening twilight of a fair spring day, weak and
weary, I came in sight of the old homestead once more.
Over the joy and gladness of such a meeting after an
absence, every day of which had seemed to those I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
left behind, an age of agony and dread, it is meet that the
mantle of silence should fall. The halo that came to fathers
and mothers hearts in those old days when their
"boys" came home from the war, seemed like a breath
from Heaven. It was sacred then and to me it is sacred
still. Loving lips, that gave me glad welcome that spring
day have long been cold and silent, and eyes that shone
through misty tears are dim in death. Some time in the
coming months or years, I know not when, and yet in
God's good time, in weakness and in weariness at even-tide
on some spring day again, it may be, I shall, I trust,
go "home again;" not to the old homestead hallowed as
it is by a mother's love and a father's prayers, and yet to
find hard by the River of Life from lips long silent, a
welcome just as loving in "a city, whose builder and
maker is God."</p>

<h3>REORGANIZATION WITH 12th GA. BATTALION.</h3>


<p>On May 1, 1862, the Oglethorpes were re-organized
at Camp Jackson, on the Carnes Road, near Augusta,
Ga., as an artillery company under Capt. J. V. H. Allen.
Three other companies from the 1st Ga. Regiment, and
the "DeKalb Rifles" from Stone Mountain, joined us
and the 12th Ga. Battalion was formed, with Major
Henry D. Capers as commander. We remained at this
camp drilling for two months, and our parade ground
became a favorite afternoon resort for the young ladies
of Augusta.</p>


<h3>A "LITTLE LONG."</h3>

<p>Among the fair visitors, who honored us by their presence,
were the Misses Long, two pretty and attractive
girls, who were guests at the Savage Place, near our
quarters. Miles Turpin, one of the company wits, fell a
victim to the charms of the younger one, who in physical
make-up was rather petite. When his attack had
reached the acute stage, he was being joked about it one
day and gave vent to his feelings in the following revised
version of Goldsmith's familiar lines:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I want but little here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But want "that little Long."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Miles was not the only wit in the Company. Every
branch in Phil Schley's family tree must have shed puns
as an ordinary tree sheds leaves when touched by the
breath of winter. Lon Fleming was crossing the grounds
at Camp Jackson one day with a chair slung over his
left shoulder, when he was hailed by Phil. "Lon, you are
most cheerful man I've seen today." "Yes," said Lon,
"over the left." Lest some of my readers may fail to see
the point, it may be prudent to say that when Phil and I
were boys, "chair" in the piney woods was pronounced
"cheer." This was not one of Phil's best nor, perhaps,
one of his worst. It would probably grade about "strict
low middling." Aside from this hereditary punning propensity,
from which my old comrade has reasonably recovered,
I am glad to recall his unfailing good humor
and his readiness to meet the dangers and hardships of
the service bravely and without a murmur.</p>


<h3>THE 12th GA. BATTALION FLAG.</h3>

<p>On July 4th, '62, Miss Pinkie Evans, of Augusta,
presented to the battalion a beautiful silk battle flag
made, it was said, from her mother's wedding robe. Her
patriotic address in making the presentation was responded
to by Maj. Capers, who accepted the colors for
the battalion.</p>

<p>As the Oglethorpes were transferred from the battal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ion
in the fall of 1862, we had no opportunity of fighting
under their banner save at the skirmish at Huntsville,
Tennessee. It was afterwards bravely borne on many a
bloody battlefield, under Evans and Gordon in Maryland
and Virginia. Seven color-bearers were shot down under
its silken folds. During the second heavy bombardment
of Fort Sumter, lasting from Oct. 26 to Dec. 6,
1863, the 12th Ga. Battalion formed a part of its garrison.
On Oct. 31st the flag of the fort was shot down and was
replaced by Serg. Graham, Will Hitt and Bob Swain, of
Augusta, then serving with the 12th Ga. Batt. It was
shot down again on the same day and its staff so badly
shattered that it could not be hoisted. The same brave
men went up on the parapet, amid the storm of solid
shot and shell and raised their own 12th Ga. flag. When
the Confederate line was broken at Cedar Creek, Serg.
Hopps of Crump's company, bore this flag, and disdaining
to fly, he held his ground alone, waving his colors
defiantly at the advancing line of blue until he was
killed. Afred Wallen, of the same company, a beardless
boy, but a brave one, saw him fall and running back at
the risk of his own life, tore the flag from its staff and
brought it in safety to his command. It is said these
colors were not surrendered at Appomatox, but were
returned to their fair donor unstained save by the blood
of the gallant Baker and King and Stallings and Hopps,
who in the shock of battle had gone down to death under
their silken folds.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h3>OFF TO THE FRONT</h3>

<p>Buell was threatening Chattanooga, and Maj. Capers
was ordered to report with his battalion to Gen. McCown
at that point. Leaving Augusta July 5th in two
special trains, we were detained at Ringgold, Ga., for a
day or two by a collision with a freight train, which resulted
in the death of ten or twelve men and fifteen or
twenty horses, and in injuries more or less serious to a
larger number. Reaching Chattanooga July 8, we remained
there ten days and were then transferred by N.
&amp; C. R. R. to a point near Shell Mound, Ala. Picketing
here for two weeks in front of Buell's army we returned
to Chattanooga Aug. 1, and on the next day left for
Knoxville with the intention, I suppose, of accompanying
Kirby Smith's army into Kentucky. Two days at Knoxville
and we are off for Clinton. En route a courier
brings information that the enemy has attacked our
forces at Tazewell, twenty miles away, and we are ordered
to hurry forward to reinforce Gen. Stevenson at that
point. An hour later another dispatch is received that the
attack has been repulsed and we are sidetracked at Clinton
to aid in the capture or dispersion of the 7th Tenn.
Federal regiment, then occupying a fortified camp near
Huntsville, Tenn.</p>


<h3>COL. HOGELAND AND HIS WAR DIARY.</h3>

<p>How strangely human events sometimes shape themselves
without apparent effort to control them. Sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in my home some weeks ago in the dreamy haze of an
October Sunday afternoon, there chanced to fall under
my eye in the editorial column of a Sunday school paper
the statement that Col. Alexander Hogeland of Louisville,
Ky., had visited Nashville, Tenn., in the interest of
the "Curfew Law." Other items in the column caused a
momentary disturbance of my brain cells, then passed
away to be recalled no more. But this one lingered in
my memory and would not down, for thereby hangs the
following tale:</p>

<p>The expedition against the Federal force at Huntsville
was commanded by Col. Gracie, of Alabama, and
consisted of the 12th Ga. Battalion, a portion of an Alabama
regiment, and a few cavalry. Leaving Clinton at 4
p. m., Aug. 12, we camped near Jacksonboro on the
night of the 13th and on the morning of the 14th started
for Huntsville by a rough mountain path that crossed a
spur of the Cumberland range. After a toilsome tramp
we halted at 9 p. m. and after an hour's rest were again on
the march. The path is narrow and the overarching trees
shut out every ray of starlight. Groping along in the
dark we follow the tramp of the feet in front, reaching
out occasionally to touch the file just ahead, lest our ears
have deceived us. Our pathway passes on the edge of a
precipitous bluff and my brother in Crump's company
loses his footing and topples over it. The fall fails to disable
him, but he loses his hat and in the darkness is
unable to recover it. Hatless he rejoins the command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and the procession moves on. Just before daylight we
halt for another rest. At 5 a. m. we resume the march
and in the early morning reach the vicinity of the Federal
camp. Deploying into line of battle we advance
through a belt of woodland and entering a cornfield beyond,
our right is fired upon by the Federal pickets. As
we drive them in a scattering fire is kept up until we
come in sight of their camp and near it a rude log fort
built upon the crest of a tall hill, over whose precipitous
slope the forest trees have been felled, making an almost
impassable abattis. While arrangements are being
made for an attack upon the fort, Tom Tutt and the
writer, who are both on the color guard, see a thin line
four or five hundred yards to our right, near a church,
and whom we take to be the pickets, who had been resisting
our advance. Tom, whose rule is to shoot at
everything in sight, selects his man and fires and the
writer follows suit. We load and fire again. After a few
rounds I become convinced that it is a portion of Capt.
Crump's company, which had been detached and sent
to the right and in which I have two brothers. As Tom
raises his gun again I said, "Hold on, Tom, you are
shooting at your own company." He made no reply and
continued firing until the order to advance was given. A
deep gully lay partially in our front and as its passage
caused some confusion in the ranks, we halted to reform
the line. Crump's company was hurrying forward to join
us and before they had reached their position in line Col.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Gracie gave the command, "Charge." From underneath
the head logs of the fort the Belgian rifles were barking
at us and the heavy balls they carried whistled by us like
young shells. We were waiting for Crump, and Gracie,
ignorant of the cause of the delay, shouted: "What is
the matter with the 12th Ga. Battalion?" Just then a
lone cavalryman passed the line on foot and with drawn
sabre made his way towards the fort with the evident
intention of capturing the whole business himself.
Crump's company came up at a "double quick" and the
whole line moved forward with a yell. Sergeant Harwell,
our color-bearer, had never been under fire and the boys,
uncertain as to his grit, had asked Tom Tutt, who did
not know what fear meant, to take the colors when the
charge began. Tom made the effort to seize them, but
Harwell, a tall, gaunt man, and brother of two honored
Methodist preachers, declined to give them up and bore
them forward bravely. As we advanced the fire from the
fort suddenly ceased and we thought they were waiting
to see the whites of our eyes. Reaching the steep ascent
we climbed up over logs and brush until the fort was
gained. Lieut. Joe Taliaferro, of Augusta, was the first
to enter, and with his sword cut down the floating flag.
The fort was empty&mdash;not a Yankee to be seen. Under
cover of the thick forest growth in their rear they had
hid to other haunts, under the idea, perhaps, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He who fights and runs away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will live to fight another day."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Their camp, located just below the fort gave ample
evidence of their hasty exit. Our attack was something
of a "surprise party" and their unfinished morning meal
was boiling, baking and frying on the camp fires. We
were unexpected and uninvited guests and yet our reception
was warm, although unfriendly. Our all-night tramp
enabled us to do full justice to the breakfast they had
prepared, as well as the sugar cured hams and other supplies
their commissary had kindly left for our use. We
appropriated an ample outfit of blankets, canteens,
haversacks, etc., and burned what we could not carry
away.</p>

<p>The skirmish on our side, and probably on theirs was
almost bloodless. W. W. Bussey, of the Oglethorpes,
and Garyhan, of Crump's company, were slightly
wounded. I recall no other casualty except the killing of
a nice horse ridden by Col. Gracie.</p>

<p>And now what has all this to do with the item I read
in a Sunday school paper? Simply this: Among the assets
and effects secured that day by the writer from the officer's
tent and administered upon without "Letter's Testamentary"
was a pocket diary belonging to Capt. Alexander
Hogeland, of the 10th Indiana Regt. On reading
the paragraph referred to, the coincidence in names suggested
the possibility that Col. Alexander Hogeland, of
Louisville, Ky., "Father of the Curfew," might have been
Capt. Alexander Hogeland, of the 10th Ind. Regt., whose
property had been in my possession for thirty-seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
years. To test the matter, I wrote Col. Hogeland and
from his reply the following extract is taken: "Your
deeply interesting favor of the 4th inst received and for
the information it contains accept my hearty thanks. I
am the identical person referred to in your letter. Was
first lieutenant Co. D, 10th Indiana Regiment in the
West Virginia campaign and afterwards Captain of Co.
G. In May, '62, was made lieutenant-colonel of 7th East
Tennessee Regiment, commanded by Col. Wm. Cliff,
and stationed at Huntsville, Tenn., in August, '62. We
lost everything on the occasion you refer to and this is
the first information I have received as to the whereabouts
of my effects. I am very glad to avail myself of
your proffer to return my diary and enclose herewith
necessary postage." Col. Hogeland's diary was duly returned
to him and in acknowledging its receipt he took
occasion to thank me for looking him up after all these
years and assured me that he would endeavor to return
that kindness by visiting Augusta in the early future and
giving the citizens of this goodly city the benefit of the
"Curfew Law." It will furnish additional evidence of the
truthfulness of the opening statement in this sketch if the
capture of a war diary nearly forty years ago, should
result in the adoption of a "Curfew" ordinance in Augusta.</p>

<p>In illustration of the adage that "Every dog has his
day," it may not be amiss to say that Col. Hogeland's
escapade from Fort Cliff at the instance of four com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>panies
of the old First Georgia Regiment, was only partial
compensation for the 100-mile run made by those
self-same companies from Laurel Hill, Va., in '61, with
Capt. Hogeland's regiment as one of the exciting causes.</p>


<h3>JACKSBORO.</h3>

<p>On our return from Huntsville, Joe Derry and J. W.
Lindsay, of the Oglethorpes, unable to keep pace with
the command, straggled and were captured by "bush-whackers."
Joe was exchanged a few days, later, Lindsay
preferring to remain a prisoner. After a short stay at
Clinton we moved up to Jacksboro and remained
there until Oct. 9th, guarding Bragg's line of communications.
Our service at this place was uneventful. Buell's
army had retreated into Kentucky and there was nothing
to disturb our "otium cum dignitate" save a moderate
amount of picket duty and the one subject ever uppermost
in the soldier's mind&mdash;"rations." The following incidents
of our stay at this camp furnish some illustrations
of this fact:</p>


<h3>THE PARSON AND THE GRAVY.</h3>

<p>A continuous diet of salt bacon had made the boys
ravenous for fresh meat and as war has no tendency to
strengthen respect for property rights where a soldier's
appetite is involved, they were not, as a rule, very scrupulous
as to the methods adopted to procure a supply. The
means most in use at the date referred to were known in
camp parlance as "flip ups." As no encyclopedia of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
acquaintance describes this mechanical contrivance and
its specifications have never encumbered the records of
the patent office, it may not be amiss to say that it consisted
of a bent sapling, a slip noose with a trigger attachment
and a bait of corn. The unsuspecting porker,
tempted by the bait, sprang the trigger and the sapling
freed from its confinement, sought to resume its normal
position, while the shote caught in the noose and partially
suspended in the air gave noisy notice that the
game was up.</p>

<p>On one occasion the catch, by right of discovery or
otherwise, fell to a mess, of which Parson H&mdash;&mdash;, a minister
of the Presbyterian persuasion, was a member.
When dinner was served that day a dish of smoking
pork chops was passed to the Parson, but he declined
with the remark that his conscience did not allow him
to eat stolen meat. As the meal progressed the fragrant
odor from the dish struck his olfactories with increasingly
tempting force and he finally passed up his tin plate
and said: "I'll take a little of the gravy if you please."
He had made a brave fight for principle and his final
compromise was probably due to the fact that Paul's
vow, "If meat make my brother to offend I will eat no
flesh while the world standth," failed to include gravy in
its inhibition. He may have been further influenced by the
reflection that his refusal to indulge could not possibly
restore the porker to life again. As Jim Wilson said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas Greece (grease), but living Greece no more."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></div></div>

<p>This incident recalls the fact that Jim and the writer
had on this subject the same scruples as the Parson, and
in order to place ourselves on the line of strongest resistance
we entered into an agreement with each other
binding ourselves to total abstinence from all meat of
questionable origin until mutually released from the
obligation. The compact was religiously observed until
Hood's campaign in Tennessee in the winter of '64.
Transportation was scarce and rations were scarcer. On
one occasion two ears of corn were issued to each soldier.
Some wag in the company, probably Elmore Dunbar,
seeing that horse rations were being furnished sang
out, "come and get your fodder." On another occasion
beef was issued but no bread. We had neither lard to fry
nor salt to season, but our digestive apparatus was not
then fastidious as to condiments. It was unimportant
whether it was taken "cum grano salis" or without, so
the void was filled.</p>

<p>A fire was built of dried limbs from a brush pile and
the beef placed in a shallow frying pan to stew, Frank
Stone being the chef de cuisine. The mess sat around
with anxious faces and whetted appetites. Finally one of
them, in shifting his position, struck the end of a limb on
which the pan was resting and dumped the whole business
into the dirt and ashes. The catastrophe placed us
rather than the beef in a stew and we went to bed supperless.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it is, perhaps, but natural that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the case should be re-opened, a new trial granted and a
verdict rendered to follow Paul's other injunction,
"Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions
for conscience sake."</p>

<p>I can not recall positively that either of us ever indulged
even as to gravy, but I think I can say that neither
of us was particepts criminis in the act of impressment.
If guilty, we were only accessories after the fact.</p>


<h3>"THEM MOLASSES."</h3>

<p>During our stay at Jacksboro the farmers in that
section were making sorghum syrup, which most of them
called "them molasses." Near one of our picket posts
lived a Baptist minister named Lindsay, from whose better
half we purchased vegetables and other edibles. On
one occasion I was unable to make exact change and
left owing her 12 1-2 cents in Confederate money. Two
weeks later I was on picket again and paid her the balance
due. She was so much surprised that a soldier
should have the moral sense to recognize and meet such
an obligation that she formed a very exalted estimate of
my honesty and when I afterwards went to buy some of
"them molasses" she requested her husband to take it
from a barrel she had reserved for her own use "for,"
he said "she likes 'em powerful thick." I had occasion to
regret her kindness, for it was so thick that it was with
difficulty that I could get it either into or out of my canteen,
and in view of her partiality I did not have the heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to suggest that a thinner grade would be preferred. She
was a kind and motherly soul, and yet some of the soldiers
would steal from her. To prevent or minimize their
depredations she cooped a noisy rooster underneath her
bedroom as a sort of watch dog to notify her of any midnight
foragers. A few mornings afterwards she awoke to
find, aside from other losses, that her feathered sentinel
had been caught asleep upon his post by some soldier,
who was chicken-mouthed, if he was not chicken-hearted.</p>


<h3>RATIONS.</h3>

<p>Rations as one of the sinews of war, deserve something
more than incidental mention in these memories and as
no more favorable opportunity may occur, it may be as
well to give them more extended notice in connection
with the incident just related.</p>

<p>Confederate rations during the early years of the war
were as I recollect them, not only fair in quality but ample
in quantity. As evidence of this fact I remember that
the boys were sometimes so indifferent when rations
hour arrived that it was difficult to induce them to draw
their allowance promptly. Charles Catlin was our company
commissary and I can hear now his clear, sharp
tones as they rang out on the frosty evening air among
the Virginia mountains in '61, "Come up and get your
beef. Are you going to keep a man standing out here in
the cold all night?"</p>

<p>As the war progressed the resources of the Confeder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>acy,
limited to its own production by the cordon of hostile
gunboats that girded its ports, became more and
more heavily taxed and its larder grew leaner and leaner.
But little wheat was raised in the Gulf States and few
beeves except in Texas. We were reduced largely to meal
and bacon rations, and the supply of these sometimes
recalled the instructions in regard to loading a squirrel
rifle given by its owner to a friend to whom he had loaned
it: "Put in very little powder, if any." Cooking squads
were detailed from each company and once a day the
wagons would drive up and issue three small corn pones
to each man. Some of the boys, whose hunger was
chronic, would begin on theirs and never stop until the
last pone had been eaten.</p>

<p>Bob Winter belonged to this class and eight or ten
hours after his daily rations had disappeared Dick Morris
would draw a pone or half a pone from his haversack
and say, "Bob, here's some bread if you want it," and
Bob would reply, "Dick, I don't want to take it if you
need it," and Dick would answer, "Bob, I've told you a
thousand times that I wouldn't give you anything that I
wanted," and Bob would succumb and so would the
bread.</p>

<p>When our changes of base were rapid the squads
would cook up two or three days' rations and in hot
weather the bread would mould and when broken open
the fungus growth looked very much like cobweb. Some
of the pones had also the appearance of slow convales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>cence
from chill and fever. Under such conditions it could
hardly be considered very palatable except upon the idea
of a rustic friend of mine, who, in commending the virtues
of India Cholagogue, was asked as to its palatability.
"O," said he, "it's very palatable, but the meanest stuff
to take you ever saw."</p>

<p>Most of the boys had left well-to-do homes to enter the
service and while they bore privation and hunger without
a murmur, there would sometimes come into their
hard lives a craving for the good things they had left
behind. Gathered about the camp-fire, cold and tired and
hungry, they would discuss the dish that each liked best
and their lips would grow tremulous as they thought of
the day when hope would become realization. Joe Derry,
I remember, could never be weaned away from the
memory of his mother's nice mince pies and black-berry
jam. I can see his eyes dance now as he magnified their
merits. Bob Winter's ultimate thule in the gastronomic
line was sliced potato pie, while Jim Thomas would
never tire of singing the praises of 'possum baked with
potatoes. Louis Picquet said to him one day, "Jim, if I
ever get home again I am going to have one dinner of
'possum and 'taters if it kills me." But it was left to the
epicurean taste of John Henry Casey to reach the acme
of these unsatisfied longings when, recognizing the value
of quantity as well as quality he declared that nothing
less would satisfy him than "a chicken pie big enough to
trot a horse and buggy around on."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>But for extending this ration sketch to an irrational
length I might have said something of the May Pop
leaves that we cooked for "greens" in North Georgia, of
the half hardened corn transformed into meal by means
of an improvised grater prepared by driving nails
through the side of a tin canteen, of the pork issued to us
in Tennessee with the hair still on it, of the hog skins
that we ate at Inka, Miss., and of many other such
things, but they would probably fail to interest the reader
as they did the actors in those far off days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<h3>TRANSFERRED TO THE COAST.</h3>


<p>Our enlistment as artillery had so far proven a delusion
and a snare. The Confederacy had no guns with which
to equip us and we had found no opportunity to capture
any. During our stay at Jacksboro Capt. Allen succeeded
in securing from the War Department the transfer
of the Oglethorpes to the 2nd South Carolina Artillery,
then in service at Charleston. Oct. 9, '62, at 6 p. m.
we fell into line, gave three cheers for our late companions
in arms and as the setting sun crimsoned with
its last rays the lofty summit of the Cumberland, we filed
out of the village to the tune of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We are sons of old Aunt Dinah,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we go where we've amind to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we stay where we're inclined to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we don't care a&mdash;&mdash;cent."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">and our sojourn in Jacksonboro was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Reaching Augusta Oct. 13, we were dismissed until
the 23rd, when we went into camp at the Bush Ground,
near the city. Why we did not proceed at once to our
command in Charleston has always been to the writer an
unsolved problem. We remained in Augusta until Dec.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
9, when orders were received to report to Gen. H. W.
Mercer, at Savannah. Col. Geo. A. Gordon, in command
of the 13th Ga. Battalion was endeavoring to raise
it to a regiment. As he lacked two companies and as the
Oglethorpes had 120 men on its roll an effort was made
to divide the company. On Dec. 11 a vote was taken,
the result showing a majority against division. Dec. 15
we were formally attached to the 63rd Ga. Regiment,
ranking as Co. A. Our quarters were located just in the
rear of Thunderbolt Battery and here we remained for
more than twelve months in the discharge of semi-garrison
duty.</p>


<h3>A STUDY IN INSECT LIFE.</h3>

<p>The period covered by our service on the coast formed
a sort of oasis in our military life. The Federal gunboats
were kind enough to extend social courtesies to us
only at long range and longer intervals. We fought and
bled, it is true, but not on the firing line. The foes that
troubled us most, were the fleas and sand fleas and mosquitoes
that infested that sections. They never failed to
open the spring campaign promptly and from their
attacks by night and day no vigilance on the picket line
could furnish even slight immunity. If the old time
practice of venesection as a therapeutic agent was correct
in theory our hygienic condition ought to have been
comparatively perfect. During the "flea season" it was
not an unusual occurrence for the boys after fruitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
efforts to reach the land of dreams, to rise from their
couches, divest themselves of their hickory shirts and
break the silence of the midnight air by vigorously
threshing them against a convenient tree in the hope of
finding temporary "surcease of sorrow" from this ever-present
affliction. It was said that if a handful of sand
were picked up half of it would jump away. I can not
vouch for the absolute correctness of this statement, but
I do know that I killed, by actual count, one hundred
and twenty fleas in a single blanket on which I had slept
the preceding night and I can not recall that the morning
was specially favorable for that species of game
either. I remember further that as we had in camp no
"Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," I
corked up an average specimen of these insects to see
how long he would live without his daily rations. At the
end of two weeks he had grown a trifle thin, but was still
a very lively corpse. But these were not the only "ills,
that made calamity of so long a life," for as Moore
might have said, if his environment had been different,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Oft in the stilly night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere slumber's chain had bound me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I felt the awful bite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of 'skeeters buzzing 'round me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Their bills were presented on the first day of the
day of the month and, unfortunately, on every other
day. At our picket stations on Wilmington and White
marsh Islands and at the "Spindles" on the river where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the young alligators amused themselves by crawling up
on the bank and stealing our rations, there was a larger
variety known as gallinippers, from whose attacks the
folds of a blanket thrown over our faces was not full
protection.</p>

<p>But there were still others. On dress parade in the
afternoons, while the regiment was standing at "parade
rest" and no soldier was allowed to move hand or foot
until Richter's band, playing Capt. Sheppards Quick
step, had completed its daily tramp to the left of the line
and back to its position on the right, the sandflies seemed
to be aware of our helplessness and "in prejudice of
good order and military discipline" were especially vicious
in their attack upon every exposed part of our
anatomy. Capt. C. W. Howard, I remember, was accustomed
to fill his ears with cotton as a partial protection.
I have seen Charlie Goetchius, while on the officers'
line in front of the regiment, squirm and shiver in such
apparent agony that the veins in his neck seemed ready
to burst. Neither whistling minies, nor shrieking shells,
nor forced marches with no meal in the barrel nor oil in
the cruse ever seemed to disturb his equanimity in the
slightest degree. Quietly and modestly and bravely he
met them all. But the sandfly brigade was a little too
much for him.</p>

<p>In addition to these discomforts, the salt water marsh,
near which we were camped, never failed to produce a
full crop of chills and fever as well as of that peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
species of crabs known as "fiddlers." Gen. Early was once
advised by one of his couriers that the Yankees were in
his rear. "Rear the d&mdash;l," said old Jubal, "I've got no
rear. I'm front all round." These fiddlers seemed to be
in the same happy condition. Their physical conformation
was such that no matter from what side they were
approached, they retired in an exactly opposite direction
without the necessity of changing front. But of the
chills. Of the one hundred and fifteen men in our ranks
only three escaped an attack of this disease. The writer
was fortunately one of the three. One man had fifty-three
chills before a furlough was allowed him. Quinine
was scarce and boneset tea and flannel bandages saturated
with turpentine were used as substitutes. Whiskey was
sometimes issued as a preventative. In pursuance of a
resolution formed on entering the service I never tasted
the whiskey and as soon as my habit on this line became
known, I was not subjected to the trouble of looking up
applicants for the extra ration. The dearth in medical
supplies recalls other facts showing the straits to which
the Confederacy was reduced on other lines by the
blockade of its ports. Letters written in '63, and now in
my possession, show that my brother, then Assistant
Surgeon at Tallahassee, Fla., could not purchase in that
place a pair of suspenders nor a shirt collar&mdash;that my
mess could not buy an oven in Savannah, though willing
to pay $30 for it and that I ordered shoes for Capt. Picquet,
and other members of the company from a Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Campbell at Richmond Factory, as no suitable ones
could be had in Savannah.</p>

<p>Our service at Thunderbolt was entirely devoid of
any exciting incident or episode in a martial way. If the
company fired a single shot at a Yankee during our stay
I can not recall it. On one occasion 8 or 10 volunteers
from each regiment stationed there were wanted for "a
secret and dangerous expedition," as it was termed in
the order. There was a ready response from the Oglethorpes
for the entire number wanted from the regiment.
Among those volunteers I recall the names of W. J.
Steed, J. E. Wilson, R. B. Morris, J. C. Kirkpatrick and
F. I. Stone. We never knew whether it was a contemplated
attack on Fort Pulaski or the capture of a Federal
gunboat, as the expedition failed to materialize.</p>

<p>April 18, '63, Henry Wombke of the Oglethorpes, was
drowned while bathing in Warsaw Sound, and on July
12, '63, John Quincy Adams, while returning from picket
at the Spindles was accidentally shot by George Mosher,
who had gone up on the boat to kill alligators.</p>

<p>Some official changes took place in the company during
our stay at this camp. To fill the vacancy occasioned
by the resignation of Lieut. W. G. Johnson, Charles T.
Goetchius was elected, but I have no record of the date.
On July 5, '63, the death of Major John R. Giles resulted
in the promotion on July 12, of Capt. J. V. H. Allen to
that field office in the regiment. Louis Picquet became
captain of the company, and on July 14, Geo. W. McLaughlin
was elected Jr. 2nd. Lieut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>As a part of the "res gestae" of our soldier life at
Thunderbolt, the following incident may be of some
interest:</p>


<h3>SOAP AND WATER.</h3>

<p>My earliest recollections of Thunderbolt is associated
with a fruitless effort to mix turpentine soap and salt
water. We had reached the place tired and dusty and
dirty. As soon as the ranks were broken, the boys divested
themselves of their clothing and soaping their bodies
thoroughly plunged into the salt water for a bath. The
result may be imagined. The dirt and dust accumulated
in streaks, which no amount of scrubbing could dislodge
for it stuck closer than a postage stamp.</p>


<h3>A SUGARED TONGUE.</h3>

<p>Col. Geo. A. Gordon was a pleasant, persuasive
speaker and in his address to the company urging its
division so as to complete the quota necessary for a regimental
organization he held out to us a tempting array
of promises as to our treatment if his wishes were complied
with. An Irish member of his old company heard
the speech and in commenting on it said, "Faith, the
sugar on his tongue is an inch thick."</p>

<p>The Oglethorpes, though serving as infantry, had retained
their artillery organization and Gordon in his plea
for a division, said that the incorporation of such an organization
into an infantry regiment would be an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
anomaly&mdash;that we would be "nyther fish, flesh nor fowl,"
giving the English pronunciation to the word "neither."
Some time afterward the Colonel was making his Sunday
morning inspection of quarters and had reached
Elmore Dunbar's tent. As some of Dunbar's mess were
sick, he had hoisted a yellow handkerchief over the tent
and with a piece of charcoal had placed on its front the
sign, "Wayside Home." Gordon saluted as he came up,
and then noticing the sign said, "Sergeant, what is your
bill of fare today," "Nyther fish, flesh nor fowl," said
Dunbar, and the Colonel smiled and went his way.</p>


<h3>FIRE AND FALL BACK</h3>

<p>The monotony of garrison duty and our comparative
exemption from danger during our stay at Thunderbolt,
developed the spirit of mischief in the boys to an inordinate
degree and no opportunity for its exercise was allowed
to go unimproved. Bob Lassiter, while off duty
one day, was taking a nap on a "bunk" in his cabin. His
unhosed feet protruded from the window, probably with
a view to fumigation by the salt sea breeze. Jim McLaughlin
passed by and taking in the situation called
Jim Thomas. Twisting and greasing a strip of paper they
placed it gently between Bob's unsuspecting toes, fired
the ends and then made themselves scarce in that locality.
As the lambent flame "lipped the Southern strand"
of Bob's pedal extremities, he, doubtless, felt in the language
of Henry Timrod, "Strange tropic warmth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
hints of summer seas" and probably dreamed of "A Hot
Time in the Old Town" that day. But if so his dreams
were short-lived. With a yell of pain he fell back on the
floor of his cabin, and then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hotly hurried to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the author of his woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The search was vain for chance was slim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fasten guilt on either Jim.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>SKIRMISHING FOR PIE</h3>

<p>Dessert was not a standing item on our army bill of
fare, and when, by chance or otherwise, our menu culminated
in such a course, moderation in our indulgence
was one of the lost arts. One day in '63, W. J. Steed and
I, with several other comrades chanced to be in Savannah
at the dinner hour. Our rations for a long time had
known no change from the daily round of corn bread
and fat bacon, and we decided to vary this monotony by
a meal at the Screven House. The first course was disposed
of and dessert was laid before us. Steed finished
his but his appetite for pie was still unsatisfied. Calling a
waiter he said, "Bring me some more pie." "We furnish
only one piece," said the waiter.</p>

<p>The first course plates had not been removed from the
table, but simply shoved aside. The waiter passed on and
Steed pushed the dessert plate from him and gently
drawing the other back in his front, awaited results. Another
waiter passed and thinking Steed had not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
served, brought him another piece of pie. This being
disposed of the program was again repeated and still
another waiter supplied dessert. The shifting process
was continued until his commissary department could
hold no more and he was forced to retire upon the laurels
he had won in the field of gastronomic diplomacy.</p>


<h3>STEED AND THE SUGAR</h3>

<p>My friend's penchant for pie may have had its influence
in the origin of a problem in the company, which like
the squaring of the circle has never received a satisfactory
solution. He held during his term of service the
office of commissary sergeant for the company, a position
in which it was difficult at any time and impossible
when rations were scarce, to give entire satisfaction.
These difficulties in his case were, perhaps, enhanced by
the peculiarities of his poetic temperament, which caused
him to live among the stars and gave him a distaste
for the bread and meat side of life, except possibly as to
pie. Try as faithfully as he would to show strict impartiality
in the distribution, there was sometimes a dim
suspicion that the bone in the beef fell oftener to other
messes than his own and that the scanty rations of sugar
issued weekly were heaped a little higher when his mess
had in contemplation a pie or pudding on the following
day. These suspicions finally culminated in an inquiry,
which became a proverb of daily use; an inquiry, which
formed the concluding argument in every camp dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>cussion,
whether on a disputed point in military tactics or
on the reconciliation of geological revelation with the
Mosaic cosmogony; an inquiry with which Jim McLaughlin
and Jim Fleming still salute their former commissary:
"What has that to do with Steed and the
sugar?"</p>

<p>Of course there was never any foundation for such a
feeling and probably never any real suspicion of favoritism
in the matter. These things formed the minor key
of our soldier life and served as they were intended, to
enliven its sometimes dull monotony. My friend, and I
am glad to have been honored so long by his friendship,
will pardon, I know, in the gentleness of his heart a
revival of these memories. Aside from the faithful discharge
of the difficult duties of his position, it gives me
pleasure to add my willing testimony to the silent witness
of his armless sleeve, that on the firing line and in
all the sphere of duty, to which the service called him,
he was every inch a soldier.</p>


<h3>"BUTTER ON MY GREENS."</h3>

<p>For the convenience and comfort of the soldiers going
to and returning from their commands, "Wayside
Homes" were established at different points in the Confederacy
where free lunches were served by the fair and
willing hands of patriotic young ladies living in the vicinity.
A uniform of grey was the only passport needed.
One of these "Homes" was located at Millen, Ga. Detained
there on one occasion, en route to my command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
at Thunderbolt I was glad to accept their hospitality.
Seated at the table enjoying the spread they had prepared
one of these fair waiting maids approached me
and asked if I would take some butter on my "greens."
My gastronomic record as a soldier had been like Joseph's
coat, "of many colors." I had eaten almost everything
from "cush" and "slapjacks" to raw corn and
uncooked bacon. I had made up dough on the top of a
stump for a tray and cooked it on a piece of split hickory
for an oven. I had eaten salt meat to which the government
had good title, and fresh meat to which neither I
nor the government had any title, good or bad. But butter
on "greens" was a combination new to my experience
and as my digestive outfit had, during my school
days, been troubled with a dyspeptic trend, I felt compelled
to decline such an addition to a dish that had been
boiled with fat bacon.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the absence of my friend Steed the
supply of pie that day was short, and with a degree of
self-denial, for which I can not now account, I asked for
none. A soldier next me at the table, however, filed his
application and when our winsome waitress returned,
she handed the desert to me and left my neighbor pieless.
I could not recall her fair young face as one I had
ever seen before, and I had always been noted for my
lack of personal comeliness. I was at a loss therefore to
understand why the unsolicited discrimination in my favor
had been made. A few minutes later the problem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was solved. Standing on the porch after the meal had
ended, this self-same maiden approached me a little
timidly and asked, "When did you hear from your brother
Sammie?" She and my younger brother, it seemed,
had been schoolmates, and, as I learned afterwards,
"sweethearts" as well, and the pie business was no longer
a mystery.</p>

<p>If she still lives as maid or matron and this sketch
should meet her eye, it gives me pleasure to assure her
that the fragrance of her kindly deed though based upon
no merit of my own, still lingers lovingly in my memory,
like the echo of "faint, fairy footfalls down blossoming
ways."</p>


<h3>OUR CAMP POET.</h3>

<p>"Dropping into poetry" has not been a peculiarity
confined to that singular creation of Dickens' fancy,
"Silag Wegg." While not a contagious disease, it is said
that a majority of men suffer from it at some period in
life. Like measles and whooping cough it usually comes
early, is rarely fatal and complete recovery, as a rule,
furnishes exemption from further attacks, without vaccination.
Under these conditions it is but natural that the
Oglethorpes should have had a poet in their ranks. In
fact we had two, James E. Wilson and W. J. Steed,
who has already figured somewhat in these memories,
and who was called Phunie, for short. The latter was,
however, only an ex-poet, not ex-officio, nor ex-cathe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>dra,
but ex-post facto. His attack had been light, very
light, a sort of poetical varioloid. He had recovered and
so far as the record shows, there had been no relapse.
On the first appearance of the symptoms he had mounted
his "Pegasus," which consisted of a stack of barrels
in rear of his father's barn, and after an hour's mental
labor, he rose and reported progress, but did not ask
leave to sit again. The results are summed up in the following
poetic gem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here sits Phunie on a barrel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his feet on another barrel."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He has always claimed that while the superficial reader
might find in these lines an apparent lack of artistic
finish, with some possible defects as to metre and an unfortunate
blending of anapestic and iambic verse, the
rhyme was absolutely perfect. I have been unable to discover
in them the rhythmic and liquid cadence that
marks Buchannan Reade's "Drifting," or the perfection
in measure attributed by Poe to Byron's "Ode" to his
sister, yet my tender regard for my old comrade disinclines
me to take issue with him as to the merits of this,
the sole offspring of his poetic genius. My inability to
find it in any collection of poetical quotations has induced
me to insert it here with the hope of rescuing it from
a fate of possibly undeserved oblivion.</p>

<p>Jim Wilson's case was different. His was a chronic
attack. "He lisped in numbers for the numbers came."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
As a poet he was not only a daisy, but, as Tom Pilcher
would say, he was a regular geranium. I regret that my
memory has retained, with a single exception, only fragments
of his many wooings of the muse.</p>

<p>A young lady friend, Miss Eve, of Nashville, asked
from Jim a christening contribution to an album she had
just purchased. He was equal to the occasion. The man
and the hour had met. He was in it from start to finish.
He filled every page in the book with original verse. I
recall now only the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Newton, the man of meditation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The searcher after hidden cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first discovered gravitation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ciphered out attractions laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not, with all his cogitation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find rules to govern woman's jaws."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But his special forte was parody. A competitive examination
was ordered at Thunderbolt in '63 to fill the position
of second sergeant in the company. After studying
Hardee's Tactics for a week Jim relieved his feelings in
the following impromptu effort:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tell me not the mournful numbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a "shoulder" to a "prime,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I murmur in my slumbers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make two "motions in one time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Oglethorpes, though serving as infantry had
clung tenaciously to their artillery organization and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the red stripes and chevrons which marked the heavier
arm of the service. On our assignment to Gordon's regiment,
the Colonel had made a very strong appeal to us
to divide the company and to discard our artillery trimmings.
At the next Sunday morning inspection Jim's
tent bore a placard with this inscription, intended for the
Colonel's eye:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You may cheat or bamboozle us as much as you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sign of artillery will hang round us still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Probably his masterpiece was a parody on "Maryland,"
written at Jacksonboro, Tenn., on the eve of our
transfer from the 12th Ga. Battalion. That the reader
may understand the personal allusion in the verses it is
necessary to say that Edgar Derry, Jim Russell, Ed
Clayton and Alph Rogers had been detailed by Col.
Capers to fill certain staff positions with the battalion;
that Miles Turpin was company drummer and Stowe&mdash;whose
camp sobriquet was "Calline," was fifer; that in
the skirmish at Huntsville, Tenn., W. W. Bussey, who
was known in camp as "Busky," had been shot in the
temple; that before the final charge on the fort, Col.
Capers in crossing a ditch had mired in its bottom and
had found some difficulty in extricating himself; that
the war horse of the male persuasion ridden by Col.
Gracie had been killed in the skirmish and that Randolph
was Secretary of War. When the transfer had
been effected it was uncertain whether the detailed men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
would retain their position or would return to the company,
and the following verses were written by Jim as an
appeal to them to go with us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come 'tis the red dawn of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's your mule,<br /></span>

<p>And now in conclusion, I am unwilling that my friend,
Jim Wilson should be judged solely by these rhymes. If
any allusion in them sounds harshly to ears polite, it
must be remembered that they were intended, only for
soldiers eyes and ears. The son of a Presbyterian missionary
to India, he was an educated Christian gentleman,
one of the brightest and wittiest men I have ever
known, as brave as Julius Caesar and as true to the flag
for which he fought as any man who wore the grey.</p>

<h3>THE DALTON AND ATLANTA CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>Our service on the coast ended April 28, 1864. On
April 23 orders were received transferring our regiment
to Gen. A. R. Wright's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia.
Gen. H. W. Mercer in command, had been ordered
to report for duty to Gen. Johnston at Dalton, Ga.
As Gordon and Mercer were both Savannah men and
their war service to that date had thrown them together,
they succeeded in inducing the War Department to
change our orders and assign us to Johnston's Army.
April 28 we left Savannah, reaching Dalton at 3 a. m.
April 30, and on May 4 were attached to Gen. W. H.
T. Walker's division, three miles east of Dalton. On May
7 Sherman opened his Atlanta campaign and for one
hundred days the rattle of musketry, the roar of
cannon, the shrieking of shells and the zip of minies,
grew very familiar to us, if not very amusing. Our first
sight of the enemy was at Rocky Face Ridge, May 9.
Our pickets were driven in and our trenches shelled, causing
some casualties in the regiment, but none in the
Oglethorpes. Lieut. Reddick of Co. B, while reading a
newspaper in rear of the trenches was killed by a Federal
sharpshooter. No assault was made on our position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
but at three other points in Johnston's line efforts were
made to carry the trenches, though the attacks were all
repulsed. On the same day Sherman, probably anticipating
such a result, began his flanking plan of campaign
by sending McPherson through Snake Creek Gap to
threaten Johnston's line of communications at Resaca.
The Federal superiority in numbers at a ratio of nearly
two to one, enabled Sherman to cover Johnston's entire
front and gave him besides a large force with which to
conduct his flanking operations, a policy he pursued persistently
and successfully to the end of the campaign. As
it is not my purpose to give the general features of this
campaign, but simply to record the share borne in it by
the 63rd Ga. regiment, I can, perhaps best subserve that
purpose by furnishing the following condensed extracts
from my "War Diary" for that period, elaborating afterward
any special features or incidents that may seem to
merit more extended notice.</p>

Hospital. On the 15th was sent by Medical Board
to Atlanta. On the 17th went to hospital at Oxford, Ga.
I did not rejoin my command again until Aug. 18th.
During my absence Gen. Johnston had been superseded
by Gen. Hood as commander of the Army of Tennessee,
the battles of Peach Tree Creek and Atlanta had been
fought, Gen. W. H. T. Walker, our division commander
had been killed and our brigade had been transferred to
Pat Cleburne's division. In the battle of Peach Tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Creek July 20th, our regiment was only partially engaged
and suffered but little loss. Eugene Verdery and
Henry Booth of the Oglethorpes were wounded. The former
had volunteered for service on the skirmish line that
day and while driving in the enemy's picket line received
a wound in the head, which caused him to spin around
like a top.</p>

<p>In the battle of Atlanta, July 22, the regiment was in
the thick of the fight and lost more heavily. Of the Oglethorpes,
S. M. Guy was killed. Ob. Rooks was mortally
wounded, M. H. Crowder lost a leg, R. W. Lassiter an
arm, Jim McLaughlin the bridge of his nose, while
George Leonhardt, John Bynum, Clay Foster, Hugh
Ogilby, John Quinn and J. O. Wiley were otherwise
wounded. After my return to the company, near East
Point, on the 18th the regiment was sent to the picket
line on the 19th and when relieved on the morning of
the 20th, was placed on the reserve line, where we remained
until the 30th. At 2 a. m. that day we were
aroused and ordered to "fall in," but did not move until
daylight, when we shifted position 3 or 4 miles to the
left. At 11 p. m. we were again on the march and after
a fatiguing night tramp reached Jonesboro about daylight
on the 31st.</p>


<h3>BATTLE OF JONESBORO.</h3>

<p>After investing and bombarding Atlanta for a month,
Sherman had begun his flanking tactics again by sending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
five of his corps to seize the M. &amp; W. Road at Jonesboro,
and Hardee, with his own and Lee's corps, had been sent
down to checkmate the movement. After resting a few
hours we were formed in line of battle across an old
field with only Lowry's brigade on our left. For the only
time in my experience as a soldier, the plan of battle was
read to our command. Lee's corps and two divisions of
Hardee's were to attack the enemy in front while Cleburne's
division, to which we belonged, were to advance,
then wheel to the right and attack in flank. Lying
for several hours under a hot August sun awaiting orders
to advance, I remember that, being uncertain as to my
fate in the coming fight, and unwilling to allow the letters
in my possession to fall into the enemy's hands, I
tore them up, leaving only one for the identification of
my body in case of my death. At 2 p. m. we were ordered
forward. Crossing the open field and advancing through
a piece of woodland, a battery of artillery opened on us
but their shot flew high. Sol Foreman of the Oglethorpes,
was struck by a piece of shell, but there was no other
casualty in the company. After advancing nearly a mile
we struck a boggy swamp and on its farthest edge Flint
river. Will Daniel plunged in and turning to me said,
"Come on sergeant." He had gone but a little way when
the water reached his arm pits and sword in hand he
swam across. Knowing that my cartridges would be useless
if I followed suit, I ran up the stream and found dry
passage on a log that lay across it. Reaching the crest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the hill beyond, we halted to reform the line. The horse
ridden by Col. Olmstead, our brigade commander, had
mired in the swamp, our regiment was without a field
officer and Will Daniel offered to take command of the
brigade in the final charge, which we all felt to be ahead
of us. The hill on which we stood had been occupied by
Federal cavalry and artillery, who had retired as we approached.
The roar of battle giving evidence of a fierce
engagement on our right, came to us over the hills and
valleys; Capt. Dickson of Cleburne's staff, with his
horse all afoam, his coat and vest discarded and the perspiration
trickling from his face, was riding from point
to point in the line giving his final orders and the sultry
summer air smelled viciously of powder and lead. At this
juncture a courier from Cleburne dashed up with orders
for us to retire. We had gone some distance beyond the
point intended and had become entirely detached from
the line on our right. The attack in the enemy's front
had failed to dislodge them and our two brigades could
hardly have accomplished much against five corps of the
enemy. By dusk we had resumed our original position
and our regiment was placed on the picket line. On
Sept. 1, Lee's corps returned to Atlanta and Hardee was
left with his two divisions to face an enemy whose
strength was five times his own. Relieved from picket by
a detail of Cheatham's division, we were placed in the
trenches vacated by Lee's corps. At 3 p. m. the enemy
massed heavily in front of Lewis' Ky., and Govans' Ark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
brigades and assaulted in three lines of battle, but were
repulsed. They then formed in column of companies,
making ten lines of battle, and renewed the attack. Our
breastworks at this point were inferior and were manned
only by a line in single rank.</p>

<p>With such odds the issue could not long remain
in doubt. Govans' line was broken and a
part of his brigade was captured. No assault was made
on the line held by us, though we were subjected to a
heavy fire from their skirmish line. At 10 p. m., Hardee
evacuated his position and at daylight on the 2nd, occupied
another, near Lovejoy Station. Sherman secured a
foothold on the M. &amp; W. Road and Hood, compelled to
give up Atlanta, formed a junction with Hardee on the
3rd.</p>

<p>The enemy had again taken position in our front and
skirmishing was kept up until the 8th, when they were
recalled by Sherman and the Dalton and Atlanta campaign
was ended.</p>


<h3>FURTHER MEMORIES OF THE CAMPAIGN.</h3>

<p>The following incidents oscillating as they do "from
grave to gay," and marked perhaps as much by comedy
as by tragedy, will probably be of more interest to the
reader of these records than the details just ended:</p>


<h3>"TWO AND A DOG."</h3>

<p>At the date of our transfer from the coast to Johnston's
army, our uniforms were in fairly good condition and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
bore in almost every case the insignia of rank held by
the wearer. The writer's jacket had on its sleeves the regulation
chevrons of an orderly sergeant, three bars or
stripes with lozenge or diamond above them. The troops
who had followed the fortunes of the Western army from
Shiloh to Chickamauga were not so well clad and had,
to a large extent discarded their official insignia. For
this reason they were disposed to guy us as bandbox
soldiers. Passing some of these veterans one day on the
march one of them noticed my chevrons and sang out to
his comrades: "Look there, boys. I've often hearn of
"two and a dog" but I'll be blamed if there ain't "three
and a dog." I reckon that's the way they play kyards on
the coast." The laugh that followed convinced me that my
lack of familiarity with the mysteries of the card table
was not shared by those who heard the jest.</p>


<h3>STRIPES ON THE WRONG SIDE.</h3>

<p>While we suffered from deficiencies on other lines in
the summer of '64, there was certainly no lack of rainy
weather during that campaign. The roads over which we
tramped were composed largely of a red, adhesive clay.
The writer's physical conformation gave him some right
to be classed with the knock-kneed species of the genus
homo, and in marching over the wet clay hills, the red
pigment began at his ankles and by successive contact,
traveled gradually up the inside seams of his grey trousers
until those seams and an inch-wide space on either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
side were covered for almost their entire length. Passing
one day a division resting by the roadside, one of them
noticed the peculiar condition of my bifurcated garment,
and sang out to me: "Hello, my friend; you've got the
stripe on the wrong side of your pants." I could not deny
the soft impeachment and enjoyed the laugh raised at
my expense as much as did my comrades.</p>


<h3>A CLOSE SHAVE.</h3>

<p>The battle of Resaca began May 14, '64. Walker's
division, to which we belonged, was held in reserve during
the morning and at 12 p. m., as the fighting grew
fiercer, we were ordered up to reinforce Stewart's division
in our front. A pontoon bridge had been laid across
the Oostenaula river and a courier stationed on its bank
to hurry the men across, as the railroad embankment on
the other side would protect them from the fire of a Federal
battery, which had secured the exact range of the
road over which we were passing. As we approached the
bridge Capt. Martin, commanding the company next in
our front, halted the column a moment to hear what the
courier was saying. As the march was resumed, a solid
shot from the battery struck directly in a file of fours in
Martin's company killing two and wounding a third, not
more than ten feet from where I stood. The time occupied
in the halt would have about sufficed to have covered
the intervening distance, and certainly saved the
lives of some of the Oglethorpes and possibly my own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Crossing the river, Gen. W. H. T. Walker passed us
going to the front and as he rode by, another shot from
the battery struck immediately behind him, barely missing
his horse. Glancing around at the dust it had raised
and turning to us with a smile on his face, he said, "Go
it boots," and galloped on to the head of the division.
On this, as well as on every other occasion when under
fire, he seemed not only absolutely indifferent to danger,
but really to enjoy its presence. Gen. Cabell, in recalling
his association with Gen. Walker in the '60's, said that
battle always brought to his eyes an unusual glitter and
that he thought him the bravest man he had ever known.</p>

<p>A hero in three wars, severely wounded at Okeechobee,
Fla., and at Molino Del Rey and Chapultpec, Mex.,
he fell at last gallantly leading his division at the battle of
Atlanta, July 22, '64, and I am sure no battle soil on
God's green earth in all the ages was ever stained by
braver or by nobler blood than William Henry Walker's.</p>


<h3>A TWILIGHT PRAYER MEETING.</h3>

<p>On May 19, '64, Sherman and Johnston were fronting
each other near Kingston, Ga. In the skirmishing that
day the Oglethorpes had suffered some casualties, among
them one that saddened all the company. Hugh Legare
Hill, son of Hon. Joshua Hill, a beardless boy, had been
shot through the head and instantly killed. He had joined
us some months before at Thunderbolt and becoming
restive under the inaction of coast service, had ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>plied
for a transfer to Johnston's army. Chafing under
the delay brought on by military red tape in such matters,
and anxious to secure a place on the firing line he
had urged the officers to press the matter as he wanted
to reach his new command in time for the opening of the
spring campaign. Before the papers were returned our
regiment was ordered to Dalton and the transfer was
abandoned.</p>

<p>Poor Legare! The spring campaign had not yet drifted
into summer before his bright young life, that knew no
other season, but its spring, had found its sad and sudden
ending on the firing line, a place for which he longed
so ardently and met so bravely.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day we occupied a line near
Cass Station, a line chosen by Johnston for a general
and decisive engagement with Sherman's army. The Fabian
policy, that had marked the campaign from its
opening, was to be ended. The gage of battle was thrown
down and Atlanta's fate was to be settled before another
sunset. Every arrangement for the coming conflict was
made and the men ready and anxious for the fray were
resting on their arms. At the twilight hour two members
of the Oglethorpes left their places in the ranks
and retired to a quiet spot in the forest not far away to
talk with God. No church spire raised its lofty summit
heavenward. Under the open sky in one of "God's first
temples," as dusk was deepening into night, they kneeled
together and each in turn, in tones of earnest supplica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>tion,
asked for God's protecting care upon themselves
and on their comrades in the coming battle and for His
blessing on the flag for which they fought and prayed.
And when their prayers were ended, they pledged each
other that if it was the fate of either one to fall, the other
would act a brother's part and give such aid and comfort
as he could.</p>

<p>Returning to their places in the line, they wrapped
their worn, grey blankets around them and lay down under
the starlight to pass in calm and quiet sleep, the
night before the battle. I have attended many larger
prayer meetings since that day; I have heard many petitions
to a Throne of Grace, clothed in more cultured
phrase, and yet but few that seemed more earnest or filled
with simpler trust in God.</p>

<p>Under the urgent protest of Hood and Polk, Joe
Johnston's plans were changed and the promised battle
beside the Etowah was never fought. I know not what
the issue would have been, personal or national. I know
that if the hundred and fifty thousand men marshalled
upon that field on that May day had met in deadly strife,
the shadows would have fallen on many a Northern and
many a Southern home. And yet somehow I can but feel
that if that evening's bloody promise had been fulfilled
and in the gathering twilight at its close our company
roll was called to mark the living and the dead, my friend
and comrade, Steed, and I, whose humble prayers
had broken the silence of the evening air to reach no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
other ears but ours and God's, would in His kindly
providence have answered, "Here."</p>


<h3>TOM HOWARD'S SQUIRREL BEAD.</h3>

<p>On May 28, '64, we were on skirmish line near Dallas,
Ga. The remainder of the brigade had left the trenches
in our rear to reinforce some other point in the line and
the pickets were holding the fort alone. A Federal sharpshooter
had secured a concealed position at short range
and was picking off the men in a way highly satisfactory
to himself, perhaps, but decidedly unpleasant to us. We
had been on duty all the night before and worn out from
loss of sleep. I sat down with my back to a tree as a protection
from careless bullets and fell asleep. Will Daniel,
in a similar position and for like reasons, was dozing at
the next tree twenty feet away. A courier came down
the line and waking me asked for the officer in command.
I pointed to Will and as the courier laid his hand
on Will's shoulder to wake him, a ball crashed through
his knee, causing him to scream with pain. A little while
before Louis Picquet had received the wound that cost
him his leg, and a little later McCurdy of our company,
fell with a ball through his head.</p>

<p>Tom Howard had been watching the progress of
events and they seemed to him entirely too one-sided.
Gripping his rifle more tightly and with the peculiar
flash that came to his eyes when excited, he said, "Boys
if I can get a squirrel bead on that fellow I can stop his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
racket." Slipping from tree to tree until he located the
picket by the smoke of his gun, he drew his squirrel bead
and fired. This time the yell of pain came from the other
side, and Tom, with his eyes dancing and his face all
aglow, turned to us and said, "Boys, I got him. I heard
him holler." Tom's bead had stopped the racket.</p>


<h3>"WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER."</h3>

<p>Tom was one of the "characters" in the company.
Brave and generous, full of life and humor and always
ready for duty, he would sometimes grow a little homesick.
One day, Ab Mitchell, sitting on the edge of the
trenches, began to sing, "When this cruel war is over."
So far as I know, Ab had never taken first prize at a
singing school, but as Tom listened, the plaintive melody
of the air and the undertone of sadness in the verses
carried him back to his old home in Oglethorpe. Every
feature of the old plantation life rose vividly before him.
He heard the "watch dog's honest bark bay deep-mouthed
welcome" as he drew near home. He slaked his thirst
from the "old oaken bucket that hung in the well." He
heard the lowing cows and saw the playful gambol of his
blooded stock cantering across the barn yard. He saw
the blooming cotton fields and heard the rustling of the
waving corn. But last and best of all, he felt the pressure
of tiny arms about his neck, the touch of loving lips upon
his own and then his dream was over. With tears in the
heart if not in his eye, he thought of the life that lay <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>before
him; of the weary months or years that would
come and go before these old familiar scenes would gladden
his eyes again, and he could stand it no longer. Rising
suddenly he seized his old rifle and turning to the
singer, he said, "Ab Mitchell, if you sing another line of
that song, I'll blow your blamed head off." And the concert
ended without an encore.</p>


<h3>"JIM, TOUCH OFF NO. 1."</h3>

<p>During this campaign, Major Bledsoe of Missouri,
commanded a battalion of artillery in Cleburne's division.
A veteran of two wars, combining in his personality
both the Southern and Western types, tall and
gaunt, with no trace of Beau Brummellism in his physical
or mental make-up, he was as stubborn a fighter
as the struggle produced on either side, and yet away
from the battlefield he was as gentle and as genial as a
woman. So accurate were his gunners and so effective
their fire, that it was said that no Federal battery had
ever planted itself in range of his guns, when they were
once unlimbered.</p>

<p>As he sat by his battery one day in May, '64, reading
a newspaper, a stranger approached him and said, "Major,
where are the Yankees?" Raising his eyes from the
paper a moment he turned to one of his gunners and
said: "Jim, touch off No. 1," and resumed his reading.
"Jim" pulled the lanyard, there was a puff of smoke, the
earth trembled from the concussion and the six-pound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
messenger sped on its mission of death. As it reached its
mark, which had been hidden by the undergrowth in
front, the "blue coats" were seen scattering in every
direction. The stranger was answered.</p>

<p>As I may have no further occasion to refer to Major
Bledsoe in these records, an incident or two occurring
some months later may not be amiss in this connection.
On October 29, '64, near Courtland, Ala., on our trip
to Nashville, a grey fox crossed our line of march,
passing between two of the regiments. The Major was
riding by and spurring his horse to full speed, he gave
chase, trying at every step to disengage his pistol from
the holster for a shot at the animal. I think he failed to
secure the "brush." The Reynard tribe must have been
numerous in that section, for on reaching our camping
place that evening, we found Pat Cleburne and his entire
staff chasing another fox through an old field.</p>

<p>After the retreat from Nashville our division was ordered
to North Carolina and in the transfer the trip from
Selma to Montgomery, Ala., was made by steamer. The
boat was old and slow, and the voyage monotonous.
To enliven it, the boys, for lack of better game, would
try their marksmanship on every buzzard that in silent
dignity sat perched on the tall dead pines that lined the
river bank. Major Bledsoe was with us, and constituting
himself a "lookout" for the game, he entered into the
sport with all the zest and ardor of a boy. He was probably
no blood kin to "Jim Bludsoe" of Prairie Belle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
fame, but under similar conditions I believe that like
"Jim" he would, regardless of his own fate, have</p>

<h3>ANOTHER STAMPEDE.</h3>

<p>Mention has been made of a panic that occurred on a
night march near Green Brier river, Va., in '61. A similar
stampede occurred on the night of May 25, '64, near
Powder Springs, Ga. We were in reserve and were shifting
position to the right. The night was dark and none
of us knew the object of the movement or our destination.
Tramping along quietly under a moonless sky over
a country road darkly shaded by a heavy forest growth,
a sudden rumbling was heard, increasing in volume as
it approached and then the column in front dimly seen
in the starlight, swayed to the right and there was a unanimous
movement to get out of the way and to get quickly.
One man, thoroughly demoralized, broke through the
woods at full speed in the darkness, ran into a tree, that
stood in his pathway, and dislocated his knee cap. Most
of the men thought the enemy's cavalry were charging
down the road upon them and they took to the woods
and did not stand upon the order of their going. The
rumbling was caused by the hurried tramp of feet as the
men left the road. It was simply a causeless stampede
and no one knew how it began. It was said that a deer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
ran across the road in front of the column, but I can not
vouch for the correctness of this explanation.</p>

<p>I do not know how it may have been with others, but
to the writer the expectation of meeting an unseen enemy
in the dark, with no means of ascertaining his numbers
or location, was never a pleasant sensation. It would
have modified the feeling, perhaps, if I had borne in
mind always the advice of a Confederate general to his
men to "remember that the other side is as badly scared
as you are."</p>


<h3>A SUMMER DAY ON THE FIRING LINE.</h3>

<p>It was a day in June, but neither a perfect nor a rare
June day. For two weeks and more it had rained almost
continuously. Every day or two Jabe Poyner, the weather
prophet of the company, had said, "Well boys, this is
the clearing up shower." And still it rained and rained
and rained until Poyner's reputation on this line had
gone where the woodbine twineth. In the early morning
of the 18th there was another of Jabe's clearing up
showers and at its close the boys were lying on the wet
ground, a hundred yards in rear of the breastworks,
awaiting orders. They had amused themselves for a
time by shooting pebbles at each other, when Bill Byrd's
foot was struck and he said, "Boys, don't shoot so hard&mdash;that
one hurt." Looking down at his foot, he found that
another partner had entered the game as it had been hit
by a minnie ball from the skirmish line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The firing had begun at daylight and was growing
heavier. At 8 a. m. six companies of the regiment were
ordered to the front to reinforce our skirmish line, which
was being pressed back. "Over the breastworks, Oglethorpes,"
sang out Lieut. Daniel, and we went over
with a yell. Advancing and deploying under fire, we
reached a position within 250 yards of the Federal line
and having no rifle pits, we availed ourselves of such
protection as the larger forest trees afforded. Selecting a
post oak, I had been there only a little while when the
man on my right, belonging to another company, was
shot down. The woods were very thick in my front and
not relishing the idea of being killed with such limited
opportunity of returning the favor, I shifted my position
to the leeward side of a red oak, twenty or thirty feet to
the left where the woods were more open and a Federal
rifle pit in front was only partially hidden from my view.
The diameter of the tree about covered my own and
there for twelve hours, in a drizzling rain, I cultivated
the acquaintance of that oak more earnestly perhaps
than I had ever fostered a personal friendship. For that
day at least it was "my own familiar friend in whom I
trusted," and if on bidding it adieu, I had met the owner,
my prayer to him would have been,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woodman spare that tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mar not its noble shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Today it sheltered me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From "minnie" and from "grape."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></div></div>

<p>All day long leaden messengers were knocking at the
door of my improvised breastwork in search of my long
and lank anatomy. It was barked and scarred and torn
from the root to twenty feet above my head. Twice the
bark was knocked into my eyes and once a ball striking
at the foot of the tree filled them with dirt. On one of
these occasions I must have flinched a little as George
Harrison, who was cultivating friendly relations with the
next tree on my right, turned anxiously and asked if I
was shot.</p>

<p>The Federal line as a rule stuck rather closely to their
pits and not feeling authorized to waste my ammunition
I fired only when there was a blue target in sight. Some
of the boys, less careful of their cartridges expended 80
or 90 rounds during the day. John Carroll, ten feet to
my left, kept firing when I could see no game, and I said
to him, "John, what are you shooting at?" "Well," he
said, "they are down that way." Before the day was
ended some of them "down that way" had shot him
through the thigh, and the poor fellow died of the wound.</p>

<p>In addition to the incessant infantry fire, which made
small lead mines of the friendly oaks, the Federal artillery,
not wishing to be lacking in social attentions, complimented
us at short intervals with volleys of grape.
These came over us like the whir of a covey of overgrown
partridges, but fortunately flew high, causing
more nervousness than execution.</p>

<p>Ninety thousand rounds of ammunition were fired on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Hardee's line alone that day and our friends on the other
side expended probably an equal or larger number. There
was no intermission for lunch. Our rations were nearly
half a mile away and the Northern exposure of the route
towards them somehow dulled our appetites. There are
several incidents that come back very vividly today from
that twelve hours' fright in the woods.</p>


<h3>A SQUIRREL HUNT UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h3>

<p>One of these incidents furnished an exhibition of coolness
under fire and indifference to danger that had no
parallel in all my term of service. About midday I heard
several shots fired a short distance in my rear. Fearing
that some excited soldier might fire wildly and shoot me
in the back, I turned to investigate, and saw a member
of the regiment standing in an exposed position and
coolly and deliberately firing, not at the enemy, but at
a squirrel he had discovered in the branches of the tree
above our heads. Grape shot were tearing the limbs from
their sockets, minies were making music in the air, or
striking the oaks with a dull, dull thud, but that soldier,
was oblivious to everything save a determination to have
fried squirrel for supper. If I knew his name I cannot
now recall it, nor do I remember whether the squirrel
was included in the casualties of that day.</p>


<h3>JIM THOMAS' DILEMMA.</h3>

<p>During the afternoon Jim and a Yankee picket had
been taking alternate shots at each other and it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Yankee's time to shoot. Jim was nestling up to the
Southern side of his tree and thinking possibly of all the
meanness he had ever committed in order to feel as small
as possible, when a cannon ball crashed through the tree,
cutting off its top and sending it by force of gravity, in
the direction of his head. He was in a dilemma. If he remained
where he was he was liable to be crushed to death
by the falling timber, and if he left his cover the picket
would probably kill him. Under ordinary circumstances
Jim may not have been averse to taking a "horn," but in
this dilemma he was undecided which horn to take,
whether to bear the ills he had or fly to others, that unfortunately
he knew too well.</p>

<p>"All things come to him who waits," but in this case
there was something coming that Jim didn't care to wait
for. Doing perhaps the rapidest thinking of his life he
decided if he had to shuffle off this mortal coil, he would
do so in a soldierly way, and leaving the protection of
his tree he gave his antagonist a fair shot. Fortunately
the aim was bad and Jim lived to laugh over his deliverance
from a sea of troubles.</p>


<h3>A POOR GUN OR A POOR GUNNER.</h3>

<p>Obliquely to the right of my position in the line, and
about 250 yards distant as I estimated it, there was a
shallow ravine or valley and 20 or 30 feet beyond, on its
further slope, a Yankee rifle pit. For reasons which readily
occurred to the writer at the time and which will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
probably suggest themselves to the reader, I did not
take the trouble to verify my estimate of the distance by
stepping it. About the center of this depression in the
land was a very large tree&mdash;a pine, as I recollect it. On
the farther side of this tree and hidden by it entirely from
my view for the larger part of the day was a six-foot
Yankee soldier, an officer probably, for he had no gun
in his hand. During the afternoon, to protect himself
from the fire of other skirmishers on my right, he had
"inched" around the tree until his body from his knee
upward was in plain and unobstructed view of my position.
It was drizzling rain and his shoulders were protected
by a blue blanket thrown across them. It was the
fairest, prettiest shot I had enjoyed during the day and
fearing that he would change his position, I aimed at his
breast rather hurriedly and fired. The shot failed even to
scare him for he didn't move an inch. Reloading as rapidly
as I could, I steadied the gun against the red oak
and with as deliberate aim as I had ever taken at a squirrel
in my boyhood I fired again. And still he moved not.
Reloading again I took even longer aim and when the
smoke cleared from the muzzle of the gun he had disappeared.
I do not think that he was either killed or disabled
as in such event I would have seen him carried to
the rear. I am glad to believe that my third shot simply
convinced him that a change of base was desirable and
that he acted upon that conviction while the smoke
obstructed my vision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>And now in at least partial extenuation of what seemed
very poor marksmanship it may not be amiss to say
that the weapon used was an Austrian rifle and was considered
a very inferior gun. With an Enfield or Springfield
rifle I think I could have made a better record, provided
always that my nerves had not been rendered unsteady
by the necessity for dodging minies for six or
eight hours. George Harrison, who took care of the tree
nearest me on the right has always insisted that I did
redeem my reputation on that day, but with so many
guns in possible range of the same point it was impossible
for him to have known definitely whose shot was
effective. Such a result, if positively settled, would be to
me now only an unpleasant memory and while in the
discharge of my duty as a Confederate soldier and in
justice to the cause, for which I fought, I lost no opportunity
and spared no effort to lessen the number of effectives
on the other side, it has been a gratification to me
to have no positive knowledge that my efforts were ever
successful.</p>


<h3>SAVED FROM DEATH BY A BIBLE.</h3>

<p>Evan H. Lawrence, of Morgan county, and a member
of the Oglethorpes, occupied that day a position
about 20 feet to my left. He had in his left breast pocket
and covering his heart, a Bible. During the day a minie
ball struck the book and passing partly through, stopped
at the 7th verse of the 52d chapter of Isiah. But for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the protection furnished by the book it would probably
have produced a fatal wound. He told me afterwards
that the subject matter of that special chapter had been
in his thoughts all day. He survived the war, entered
the ministry of the Baptist church and preached his first
sermon from the text named above: "How beautiful
upon the mountains are the feet of Him that bringeth
good tidings, that publisheth peace," etc. I am satisfied
that the incident and the peculiar significance of the text
had a controlling influence in the selection of his life
work after the war. He fought a good fight, both as a
soldier and a Christian, and I feel assured, has received
his certificate of promotion in the ranks of the army
above.</p>

<p>At 8 p. m. we were relieved and returned to the
trenches. Twelve hours' continuous fighting had rendered
us hungry for rest as well as food, but our rations of
both were destined to be short. The beef issued to us
had been slaughtered so long and was so badly tainted
that even a soldier's appetite had to reject it. Only the
tallow or fat could be used and this was stuck on the
end of a ramrod, placed in the flame until the outer surface
was scorched and was then eaten with a relish that
the rarest dainties of a royal table would not bring to
me now. After a hasty lunch we were again on the tramp.
The roads were very muddy, the march was obstructed
by wagons in front and we made only 2 1-2 miles in four
hours. There were frequent halts and at one of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Will Daniel and the writer, standing side by side in the
mud, both fell asleep. After a time the company moved
on, but neither of us awoke until jostled by other troops
in passing us. This incident recalls the fact that on a
forced march in Tennessee afterwards, I slept walking.
The nap must have been a short one, but that I lost consciousness
was proven by the fact that I dreamed of a
young lady three hundred miles away.</p>

<p>A little after midnight we were halted on the crest of a
ridge and thoroughly worn out we lay down to rest, invoking
in our hearts if not upon our lips, blessings on
the man that invented sleep.</p>


<h3>INCIDENTS ON THE KENNESAW LINE.</h3>

<p>On the next day, 19th, we were on reserve picket all
day in the rain, but fortunately with no fighting to do.
Relieved at midnight, we retired behind the trenches, as
the writer hoped, for much-needed rest and sleep. My
only blanket had been thoroughly soaked by the rain
and knowing Gen. Johnston's predilection for changing
base at night, I was in doubt whether to take the chance
of securing such sleep as I could get in a wet blanket,
or to build a fire, dry the blanket and fall into the arms
of Morpheus like a gentleman. I chose the latter course,
spent an hour in the drying process and then lay down,
hopeful of a good night's rest. I had just fitted my angular
frame to the inequalities of the ground, when the
ominous "Fall in," Fall in.. fell like another wet blanket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
on my heart and hopes. Out into the mud and darkness
we tramped, not knowing whither we went and caring,
perhaps as little. We were finally halted near the base of
Kennesaw Mountain and on the line we were to occupy
for the next two weeks. Before dismissing the company
Will Daniel said, "An attack is expected on this line at
daylight tomorrow, and I have orders to fortify it. I am
tired and I am going to sleep. You can entrench or not,
as you choose, but I want you to distinctly understand
that you have got to hold this line in the morning, breastworks
or no breastworks."</p>

<p>Only one man remained awake to fortify and he dug
his trench in the wrong direction. Fortunately the expected
attack did not materialize next day and we found
ample opportunity to entrench before it came on the
27th.</p>


<h3>SLEEPING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h3>

<p>The ground through which our trenches ran sloped
upwards in our rear and as we were in range of the Federal
skirmish line, the balls that missed the breastworks
would strike the soil 20 or 30 feet back of them. On the
night of June 25 I was sleeping under a shelter made of
bark stripped from chestnut trees, with Will Dabney as
bedfellow. About midnight I was awakened by his groaning
and found that he had been wounded while asleep,
the ball entering his arm above the elbow and stopping
at the bone without breaking it. W. J. Steed was accus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>tomed
to use his shoes and socks as a pillow for his head,
a habit growing possibly out of his daily effort as commissary
to make both ends meet. He was a little surprised
one morning to find that a minie ball had passed through
his improvised pillow without disturbing his sleep. Geo.
McLaughlin found one morning a minie imbedded in
the heel of the shoe he had laid aside for the night. These
cases might indicate that our Northern friends were rather
partial to that kind of in-shoe-rance, but I am satisfied
that George and "Phunie" would have preferred a
different policy.</p>

<p>The fire from the skirmish line was so heavy one
morning and the balls were flying around so carelessly
that the company was ordered into the trenches. Frank
Stone and I had not finished our breakfast and as Will
Daniel had a personal interest in the meal, we secured
his consent to continue our culinary operations. I was
sitting by the fire cutting up a piece of beef for hash,
when one of those careless minies struck my right arm
near the wrist, ventilating the sleeve of my jacket and
partially disabling my arm for ten days. As a souvenir of
that temporary interruption to the hash business I have
that minie filed away among other war curios.</p>


<h3>THE VICTIM OF MISPLACED CONFIDENCE.</h3>

<p>Our stay at Kennesaw was marked by another squirrel
incident differing somewhat from that of June 18, already
referred to. A short distance in the rear of our position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a Confederate battery had been planted and between this
and the enemy's batteries there were frequent artillery
duels. So frequent were these engagements and so accustomed
did we become to the noise of the guns that if
asleep it failed to awake us, although our battery was only
seventy-five yards away. On one of these occasions we
were ordered into the trenches for protection from the
shells. Sitting in the ditch with our faces turned rearward,
some one in the ranks spied a squirrel in the
branches of a tree standing near our battery. He was apparently
crazed by the noise of the guns and the shriek
of the shells flying around him. One of the Oglethorpes
sang out to him, "Come down in the trenches&mdash;you'll
be killed up there." I don't think the squirrel heard him,
but the words had barely left his lips, when the little
animal ran down the tree, struck a bee line for the
trenches and leaped in among the men. As he made his
way down the line, some one stamped on him and put an
end to his race for life. I regretted his fate, not only on
account of his grey uniform, but for the reason that if he
was really seeking protection he had found himself the
victim of misplaced confidence.</p>


<h3>PEDICULUS CORPORIS.</h3>

<p>On the evening of June 26, Will Daniel said to me,
"Furnish 47 men for picket duty tonight. Lieutenants
Blanchard and McLaughlin will go with them. As this is
a detail, you will remain with the remnant of the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>pany
in the trenches." As Gen. Sherman had not favored
us with his confidence, neither of us knew how much,
exemption from that service meant for both of us on the
morrow. In detailing non-commissioned officers for this
detachment, Corp. L. A. R. Reab asked to be excused
upon the ground that he had received that day an outfit
of outer and under clothing&mdash;that by changing the old
garments for the new after a thorough ablution he had
succeeded in ridding himself of a camp affliction technically
known as "pediculus corporis," but usually characterized
by a less euphonious title&mdash;that picket service
in the pits would certainly bring on a renewal of the attack,
from which he desired most earnestly to have at
least a few days immunity. While he had my sympathy,
I was unable to consider his excuse a valid one, and referred
him to his commanding officer, who also declined
to relieve him. It was possibly fortunate that he failed
as he was captured next day and was kept a prisoner
until the close of the war, securing in this way exemption
from further risk in battle and perhaps a longer lease
of life.</p>

<p>In this connection it may not be amiss to say that the
Oglethorpes were, perhaps, as cleanly as any company
in the service and yet during the last year of the war I
do not think a single member was free of this affliction
for a single day. It was simply a physical impossibility
to get rid of it. Discussing this matter with my friend,
W. J. Steed some time since, I made the statement that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
during our trip to Nashville in the winter of '64, when
we had no opportunity to change our underclothing for
a month or more, it was our custom before retiring at
night, to take our flannel or hickory shirts, close the
neck and wrist, suspend them over a blazing fire and
hold them there until the air was filled with the odor of
frying meat. Steed's reply was, "I think a good deal of
you, old fellow, but I advise you never to make that
statement to any one who has not unlimited confidence
in your veracity." And yet I make it here with as full
conviction of its absolute truthfulness as any statement I
have ever made in any presence.</p>

<p>And now, bidding the "pediculus corporis" adieu with
a great deal of pleasure, I ask the reader's attention to
another theme.</p>


<h3>BATTLE OF KENNESAW</h3>

<p>The 47 men detailed for picket on the evening of the
26th, went to their posts with seven other companies
from the regiment, with no premonition of what was in
store for them on the coming day. There was the usual
desultory firing during the night, but the sunrise salute
on the 27th was not confined to a single gun. Every battery
fronting Hardee's corps and French's division, joined
in the chorus. The cannonade was heavy and continuous
until 8 a. m., when the Federal bugles sounded the
advance. As the assaulting column approached our skirmish
line, the pickets covering the divisions of Cheath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>am,
Cleburne and French retired to the trenches, where
the enemy met with a bloody and disastrous repulse. In
Walker's front their approach was hidden from view by
a dense forest growth, except on the extreme right adjoining
French, where the pits running across an open
field, were held by Co. C, of our regiment. This company
had retired with French's pickets, leaving a vacancy
in the line. The Oglethorpes were in reserve, and Maj.
Allen, misled by Capt. Buckner as to the situation and
ignorant of the fact that the attacking column had already
reached our skirmish line, ordered the company into fill
the gap. Gallantly led by Lieutenants Blanchard and
McLaughlin, they advanced at a double quick step and
on reaching the open field were met by a murderous fire
both from the front and flank, for French's deserted pits
were already occupied by the enemy. The woods to the
left and front were swarming with blue coats. On a portion
of the line held by Co. K, they had reached the pit
and a hand to hand conflict ensued. Men fought with
clubbed muskets. A short-legged Irishman of that company,
with the unusual name of John Smith, had his
gun seized by a stalwart Yankee and there was a struggle
for its possession. The little son of Erin was game,
but he was overmatched in strength and shoving his opponent
backward as the gun was wrenched from his
hands, he said, "To &mdash;&mdash; with you and the gun too."
Lieut. George A. Bailie, of Co. B, had his ear grazed by
a minie and his antagonist, twenty feet away, reloaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to fire again; having no weapon but his sword, Lieut.
B. decided to emulate David in his contest with Goliath,
and picking up a stone he threw it, striking his foe squarely
between the eyes and placing him hors de combat
for a time at least. Further up the line and near the vacant
pits, another member of the regiment, whose name
is not recalled, stood loading and firing as rapidly as his
teeth could tear the cartridges and his hands could ram
them home. His face was cold and pallid and bloodless,
but not from fear. Blackened with powder stain, through
which the perspiration trickled in streams, his eyes
flashed defiance with every flash from his gun, while disdaining
the protection of the pits he stood there a perfect
demon of war, with no thought save to kill.</p>

<p>And what of the Oglethorpes? They had picked up
something too hot to hold. Attacked both in front and
flank by largely superior numbers they were in a veritable
hornet's nest. They fought bravely to hold their
position, but the odds were too great and George McLaughlin,
seeing that it was wholesale death or capture,
sang out, "Save yourselves, boys." The place was too
hot to hold and almost to let go. For two or three hundred
yards to the rear was an open field sloping upwards.
To retire through this bullet swept as it was at short
range, was simply to court death. Obliquely to the rear
was a piece of woodland from which some protection
could be gained. Most of the men made a break for this.
Some of them ran squarely into the arms of the enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
who had possession of the woods, and were captured.
Some failed to leave the pits in time and were taken prisoners
there. Some ran the gauntlet safely, while some
brought to the rear in frame or limb a perpetual souvenir
of that warm day. With the first volley as they entered
the open field, Lieut. Blanchard was wounded and W. J.
Steed fell by his side with a ball through his lungs.
A moment later A. M. Hilzheim, who had joined us only
a day before, had received a fatal wound, and Wyatt
Chamblin had fallen with a shattered leg. When the order
to retire was given, W. J. Steed, John Weigle and Charlie
Bayliss attempted to make their way to the rear
through the open field. Steed had gone but a little way
when a ball crashed through his hand. As he slung it in
pain, another shattered his elbow and he fell. As he lay
there suffering agony from three wounds a fourth ball
broke the same arm near the shoulder. A little way off
Charlie Bayliss lay dead and John Weigle had fallen
with a broken thigh. The Federal line was re-formed in
rear of the pits and Steed and Weigle were ordered to
come in and surrender. They replied that they were unable
to go in, but that if litter bearers were sent out they
could be carried in. Just then a shell from one of French's
batteries burst over the Federal line and they took to the
woods without the ceremony of a formal dismissal.
Steed and Weigle took advantage of a temporary lull in
the firing and renewed their efforts to escape. Steed was
so weakened by loss of blood from his four wounds that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
he could only rise, stagger a little way and fall, then
rest for a time and renew the effort, while Weigle was
forced to crawl and drag his wounded limb. In the effort
he was shot in the other leg, but was finally reached
by the litter bearers and taken to the rear, one of them
being fatally wounded as they bore him off. After repeated
efforts, occupying an hour or more, Steed reached
the haven and swooned away. In this condition he
was found and rescued. He still lives, but an armless
sleeve furnishes constant reminder of the terrible experience
of that June day. Weigle, poor fellow, a model
soldier and a brave, true man, died from his wounds.</p>

<p>And now, though it is due to the truth of history, I
regret to record the fact, that while these comrades of
mine, who had been shot down on the soil of their own
State for defending their homes and firesides, were making
in bitter agony their heroic struggle for life, Federal
soldiers, schooled in Sherman's creed that "War is hell"
and that "the humanities of life have no place" amid its
horrors, concealed behind trees and under the shelter of
rifle pits, were trying to murder these men as they lay
maimed and mangled and bleeding and helpless upon
the ground. It is not a pleasant picture, and I am glad
to be able to shift the reader's attention to another that
blooms out in striking and refreshing contrast to this
product of Northern civilization. At the same hour and
less than a mile away, the attack of Palmer's corps on
Cleburne's and Cheatham's divisions met with a bloody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
repulse and as the Union line retired, exploding shells
or paper wrapping from the rifle cartridges, fired the
woods where the Federal dead and wounded lay. "Cease
firing," rang out from brave Pat Cleburne's lips, and
the rugged heroes of Granbury, Govan and Lowry,
dropped their arms and leaping the breastworks they
hurried out under the summer sun and the fiercer heat
of the blazing woods to rescue and save their fallen and
helpless foes. Comment is unnecessary and if it were, as
a reconstructed citizen of a reconstructed union, I have
no heart to make it.</p>

<p>In addition to the casualties already named Ab.
Mitchell of the Oglethorpes, lost an arm, and W. W.
Bussey, W. B. Morris, Bob Prather, Billy Pardue, Ben
Rowland and Randall Reeves were otherwise wounded.
L. A. R. Reab, Joe Derry, Willie Eve, Geo. Harrison,
Bud Howard, W. Chamblin, Jabe Marshall, Polk Thomas,
John Coffin and Lott were captured. George Pournelle's
fate was never positively known. Those who escaped
thought he was captured and those who were captured
thought he escaped. He was the last to leave his
pit, was probably killed there and falling in it was thus
concealed from the view of other members of the company.
He was my friend and messmate, brave and kind
and true. Three years' comradeship had drawn us very
close together and the mystery of his death has always
saddened me.</p>

<p>The pickets were rallied by Major Allen on a line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
nearer our trenches, but the Federals made no further
effort to advance. The brave stand made by our regiment
on the skirmish line checked the assaulting column
and by 11:30 the battle had ended. Sherman had lost
3,000 and Johnston only 630, one-eighth of it falling on
the 63rd Ga. Gen. W. H. T. Walker complimented the
regiment on its gallantry, but suggested that it be tempered
with a little more discretion.</p>


<h3>ROLL CALL AFTER BATTLE.</h3>

<p>Few scenes in a soldier's life are touched with sadder
interest than the first roll call after a battle. As Orderly
sergeant of the Oglethorpes I had to call its roll, perhaps
a thousand times, and yet I do not now remember
one that touched my heart more deeply than that which
closed that summer day at Kennesaw. The voices of
twenty-two of those who had so promptly answered to
the call of duty a few short hours before, were hushed
and silent when their names were called. Some with Federal
bayonets guarding them, were tramping to prison
dens, perhaps to slow and lingering death. Some with
mangled form and limb were suffering more than death,
while some with white cold faces turned toward the
stars, were answering roll call on the other shore. Standing
beside the breastworks on that summer evening,
under the shadow of grim and silent Kennesaw, with
twilight deepening into night, there were shadows on
all our hearts as well, shadows that stretched beyond us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and fell on hearts and hearthstones far away, shadows
that rest there still and never will be lifted.</p>


<h3>UNDER TWO FLAGS.</h3>

<p>Some time in '63 there came to the regiment a young
and beardless boy, "the only son of his mother and she
was a widow." Timid and shrinking, he was assigned to
a company in which he had neither friend nor acquaintance,
and he soon grew homesick and despondent. He
had been my brother's schoolboy friend and in pity for
his loneliness I made an effort to secure his transfer to
the Oglethorpe's. His captain declined to approve the
papers and the effort failed. Frail and unfitted to endure
the hardships of a soldier's life, he nevertheless bore up
bravely under the constant toil and danger of the Dalton
and Atlanta campaign until the battle of Kennesaw was
fought. His company was on the skirmish line that day
and suffered heavily. When the Federal line had been repulsed
and in the hush of the twilight air the roll was
called, he was reported "missing," a word that carried
with it to many a lonely home a world of agony in those
war days.</p>

<p>Two hours later a member of his company came to me
and said, "Dick is lying dead between the picket lines. If
I can get two others, will you go with us to find the body
and bring it in?" Prowling around at night between
two hostile skirmish lines in constant expectation of
being shot by either side was not a pleasant duty, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
thought of his widowed mother and, and told him I
would go. He went away to secure other help, but learned
in some way that he had been mistaken; that the dead
soldier lying cold out under the starlight was not Dick,
but another member of the regiment. A few days later
we abandoned the Kennesaw line and I heard no more
of my boy friend until the war had ended. Then I learned
through returning prisoners that he had been captured
at Kennesaw; that under the bitter cruelties of prison
life he had grown sick and helpless and was slowly dying;
that in his weakness and under the inhuman policy
of Grant and Lincoln, hopeless of release by exchange,
he was offered a chance of renewed life if he would consent
to serve against the Indians, who were giving trouble
in the far West. Lee's shadowy line was growing
thinner day by day. Hood's reckless raid on Nashville
had ended in disaster and the end had nearly come. With
the shadow of the grave resting on every prison wall
and more, perhaps, from love of mother than of life, he
yielded. But the seeds of death were sown too deeply in
his boyish frame. The prison horrors, that merit, but find
no place on Lincoln's monument, nor Grant's mausoleum,
had done their work. A few short months and
somewhere under the Western sky, far from home and
kindred, the prairie grass was weaving in the summer
sunshine, its creeping tendrils over his lonely grave.</p>

<p>Poor, gentle-hearted Dick! Deaths were common, sadly
common in those old days but the memory of his fate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
has never been recalled in all these years without a sense
of sadness and of sorrow. My heart has never judged
him save in pity and in kindness always, for I am sure
few mounds of earth have lain above a purer or a gentler
heart.</p>


<h3>AN UN-DRESS PARADE.</h3>

<p>In active service, brass bands and "dress parades" fell
largely into "innocuous desuetude." When a band was
seen going to the rear it was considered prima facie evidence
that there was a fight on hand, while an order for
dress parade dispelled any apprehension of an early
engagement. I recall one instance, however, of an undress
parade on the firing line and without a brass band
accompaniment.</p>

<p>In the early days of July, '64, the Northern and Southern
banks of the Chattahoochee formed for a time the
skirmish lines of Johnston's and Sherman's armies. One
day some of our pickets established with their opponents
on the other side a self-appointed truce. No firing
was to be done during its existence, and proper notice
was to be given of its termination. The weather was
warm and a squad of Yankee pickets relying upon the
honor of their Southern foes, decided to take a swim in
the river. Stripping themselves to the bathing suit furnished
by nature, they plunged in and were enjoying the
bath immensely. The Confederate officer of the day becoming
apprised of the temporary cessation of hostili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>ties,
sent a courier down with orders to stop the truce
and renew the firing at once. The bathers were in plain
view and in easy range of our rifle pits. Notice was given
them of the orders and they begged to be allowed time
to dress and resume their positions in their own pits. The
courtesy was accorded, but their toilets were not made
in either slow or common time. There was a hasty run
on the bank, a hurried leap into the pits and then the
crack of the rifles announced the end of the truce and of
the undress parade as well.</p>


<h3>RECKLESS COURAGE.</h3>

<p>On the same line, on another day, two opposing pickets,
who had been taking alternate shots at each other,
finally agreed on a challenge given by one and accepted
by the other, to leave the protection of their pits and fight
to a finish. The gurgling waters of the Chattahoochee
lay between them. Standing on either bank, in full view
of each other and without protection, they loaded and
fired until one was killed.</p>

<p>It was simply a life thrown recklessly away,
without reason, and with no possible good to
the cause for which he fought. Some weeks later Bob
Swain, who had been transferred to our company from
the 12th Ga. Battalion and to whom reference has already
been made in connection with the raising of Fort
Sumter's fallen flag, was on the skirmish line at Lovejoy
Station. The Yankee pickets were probably six hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
yards away, but they kept up a continuous fire and their
balls would frequently strike the head logs of our rifle
pits. So anxious was Bob to avail himself of every opportunity
to secure a shot and so utterly reckless of danger,
that he refused to enter the pit and remained in an
exposed position until he was shot through the head and
killed.</p>

<p>Picket firing in war, except when rendered necessary
by an attempted advance by one side or the other, is in
my opinion, simply legalized murder. The losses sustained
in this way can never affect the final result. "Only
a picket or two now and then" does not count "in the
news of the battle," but "in some little cot on the mountain"
the shadow of lifelong grief falls just as heavily on
the lonely wife or mother as if the victim had hallowed
by his life blood a victory that changed the fate of a
nation.</p>


<h3>WATERMELON AS A PERSUADER.</h3>

<p>During the summer of '64, Aaron Rhodes of the Oglethorpes,
fell sick and was sent to the hospital at Greensboro,
Ga. Dr. H. V. M. Miller, the "Demosthenes of
the mountains," and an ante-bellum professor in the
Medical College at Augusta, Ga., was the surgeon in
charge.</p>

<p>Aaron's father secured for him a leave of absence to visit
his home and at its expiration went to Greensboro to
procure an extension, as he was still unfit for duty. Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Miller told him that it was impossible to grant the request,
as strict orders had just been received to allow no
further leaves; that the instructions were imperative and
gave him no discretion whatever. Mr. Rhodes argued
and pleaded, but the Doctor's decision was positive and
final. At the close of the interview, Mr. R. gave the
assurance that his son would be sent up at once, and
then in taking his leave said, "By the way, Doctor, I
brought you those Richmond county melons I promised
you when I was here last and they are now at the depot
for you." "Ah; thank you," said the Doctor, "and by the
way, please say to Aaron, that after reconsidering the
matter, he can remain at home as long as he wishes, or
until able to return to duty." And Aaron's melancholy
days were not "the saddest of the year."</p>


<h3>SAVED FROM A NORTHERN PRISON BY A
NOVEL.</h3>

<p>In July '64, the writer passed through his first and only
experience either as prisoner or an inmate of a hospital.
Sherman was nearing Atlanta and his pickets lined the
northern bank of the Chattahoochee. I had been sick for
several days and Dr. Cumming, acting assistant surgeon,
insisted that I should go to the rear. With me there went
from the division hospital to Atlanta a boy soldier, who
did not seem to be over 14 years of age, and I do not
think he was as tall as his gun. If not the original of Dr.
Ticknor's "Little Giffen of Tennessee," he was certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his counterpart for he was "utter Lazarus, heels to head."
Atlanta was only a distributing hospital. The sick were
being shipped to points on the Atlanta and West Point
Road. Reports from that section were anything but
favorable. Sick and wounded were said to be "dying like
sheep." Having no special desire to die in that way or
in any other way, if possible to avoid it, I asked assignment
to some hospital on the Georgia Railroad. "All
full," said the surgeon. "No room anywhere except on
Atlanta and West Point Road. Train leaves at 7 o'clock
in the morning. Report here at that hour." As I had fully
determined not to go on that road I reported at 8 o'clock
instead of 7, and a few hours later I was pleasantly quartered
in the hospital at Oxford, Ga., where I had spent
two years of college life. Four years before, almost to a
day, I had left its classic halls little dreaming that I
should return to its familiar scenes in sickness and in
weariness, a victim of grim visaged war. For many
months the college exercises had been suspended and
the chapel, recitation and literary society halls were
being utilized as hospital wards. At the time of my arrival
the ladies and older citizens, who had not been
absorbed by the war, felt some apprehensions of a raid
into the village by Sherman's cavalry, which was only
forty miles away. Among these ladies, however, there
was one to whom the expectation of such an event
brought no feeling of anxiety. Born and reared in the
North, she felt assured that no Union soldier's vandal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
hand would molest any of her possessions. Asked by one
of her neighbors what she proposed to do in the event of
their coming she replied, "They'll never trouble me or
mine. I am just going to sit down and see the salvation
of the Lord." How it looked when she saw it, will appear
a little further on.</p>

<p>The old college chapel where I had attended morning
and evening prayer during my college course had
been converted into a hospital dining room. On July 22,
a few days after my arrival, the convalescents were taking
their midday meal in this room when the clatter of a
horse's feet was heard. There was some commotion outside
and the men hurriedly left the table to investigate
its cause. It required but a few minutes to size up the
situation. A few feet from the door on a horse covered
with foam sat a red-headed Yankee in blue uniform and
with full equipment. The expected raid had materialized
and Garrard's division of Federal cavalry had possession
of the town. Most of the convalescents returned hastily
to their quarters without finishing their dinner, The
writer, not knowing when or where his next meal would
be taken returned to the table and replenished his commissary
department to its fullest capacity. The raiders
scattered through the village, pillaging to some extent
private residences, destroying government cotton and
in this way burning the home of Mr. Irvine, an old citizen
of the place. In due time they reached the premises
of the lady, to whom reference has already been made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Her husband was not at home. He was an honored minister
of the Methodist church and was considered the
champion snorer of the conference to which he belonged.
It was said that his family had become so accustomed to
the sonorous exercise of his talent in this line that during
his absence from home at night, they were forced to
substitute the grinding of a coffee mill to secure sleep. I
am not prepared, however, to vouch for the absolute
accuracy of this statement. Whether on this occasion he
had received intimation of the enemy's approach, and
emulating the example of other male citizens of the village,
had made himself conveniently absent, I do not
now recall. His wife, possibly relying on the fact that she
was Northern born, or on providential interposition, for
exemption from any war indemnity that her blue-coated
guests might be disposed to exact, received them courteously
and as long as their levy was confined to chickens
from the barnyard or hams from the smoke house
she managed to maintain her equilibrium. But when, in
addition to these minor depredations, they bridled her
pet family horse and led him forth to "jine the cavalry,"
patience ceased to be a virtue. This crowning indignity
furnished the straw that fractured the spinal column of
the proverbial camel. She rose, in her righteous wrath
and in plain and vigorous English she gave them her
opinion of the Yankee army in general, and of her unwelcome
guests in particular. Her indignant protest was
unavailing. The stable was thenceforth tenantless, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as Tennyson might have said, she mourned for the tramp
of a vanished horse and the sound of a neigh that was
still.</p>

<p>At 3 p. m. the convalescents were formed into line
with orders to report to the provost marshal. We had
marched but a little way, when a Federal colonel ordered
us to disband until 5 p. m. I had borrowed the novel
"Macaria" from a Miss Harrison in the village and decided
to spend the interval in completing its perusal. I retired
to my cot in the college chapel, but somehow the
book did not interest me. Visions of a Federal prison
peered at me from every page and I gave it up. Having
made an engagement to take tea with Mr. Harrison's
family that evening, I concluded, if allowed to leave the
building, to return the book. Going down to reconnoiter
I saw one of our men walk up the street without being
halted, and with as indifferent air as I could assume, I
followed suit.</p>

<p>Reaching Mr. Harrison's house I found the family
anxious and excited. Mr. H., to avoid capture, had concealed
himself in the garden. I expressed my regrets to
Mrs. H. that I was unable to keep my engagement, as
I had another, which was a little more pressing. She insisted
that I remain with them until the hour for leaving
and I sat down to meditate on the fate that the future
had in store for me. When a boy I had often sung the
old hymn containing the words:</p>

<p>"Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
but the prospect that loomed up before me that summer
afternoon had no flavor of sugar or honey and, as I now
recall it, not even a trace of sorghum molasses to shade
its bitterness. As I sat there on the piazza, a Federal brigade
passed in a short distance of the house followed by
a crowd of contrabands. One of the soldiers came in and
took a ham from the pantry without taking the trouble
to ask for it. Others passed through the yard on other
errands. Nothing was said to me and I made no special
effort to attract their attention. I was saying nothing,
but I was doing some pretty tall thinking. The idea had
occurred to me, either, as Judge Longstreet has said, by
"internal suggestion or the bias of jurisprudence," that
if I remained quietly where I was, I might be overlooked
and I decided to make the experiment. At 5 p. m. the
squad of convalescents was re-formed and marched off
under guard, passing within a short distance of where I
sat. Possibly I felt that my place was properly among
them, but I felt no disposition to halt them in order to
secure it and my heart grew lighter as the line grew dim
in the distance and finally vanished. I have sometimes
been accused of being absent-minded, but on that occasion
I had reason to be grateful for being absent-bodied.</p>

<p>At nightfall I returned to my hospital cot and slept
the sleep of the just. I was in no hurry to rise next morning
until at 9 a. m., some one came in and reported that
all the raiders had shaken the dust of Oxford from their
feet. My escape was due to "Macaria" and for that reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
I have always felt kindly towards the book and its author.
In my condition a Northern prison would have
meant for me slow death and an unmarked grave and
these records would have been unwritten or penned by
other hands.</p>


<h3>A SLAVES LOYALTY.</h3>

<p>On the same day Col. H. D. Capers of the 12th Ga.
Battalion, was in Oxford recuperating from a wound
received in Virginia. Being advised of the approach of
Garrard's division, he leaped through a rear window of
his residence and taking a country road proceeded to
change his base at double-quick step. Learning of his
escape a squad of cavalry started in pursuit and on reaching
a fork in the road they asked a negro standing by
which route Col. Capers had taken. The slave, faithful to
his master's friend, intentionally misinformed them and
before the error was discovered the colonel was safely
hidden.</p>

<p>This act of faithfulness recalls the unswerving loyalty
of the race during the horrors of a four years' struggle,
whose issue meant their freedom. Suggesting as it does
the ties of friendship between master and servant in the
old slave days, it furnishes a reason for the kindly interest
the South still feels in the remnant of a class that
is fading from the earth and may account for the further
fact that on this institution, despite its faults, there rested
for a hundred years Heaven's benediction and the smile
of God.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h3>ONE AGAINST THREE THOUSAND.</h3>

<p>Rumors of the raid had been current for several days
before its occurrence, and a Mr. Jones, a citizen of Covington,
Ga., whose hatred of everything blue had been
inflamed by reports of outrages committed by Sherman's
army, pledged himself to kill the first Federal soldier
who approached his home. Learning that Garrard's division
had reached the town, he loaded his squirrel rifle and
taking his stand in front of the court house he awaited
his opportunity. He had been on post but a little while
when a Federal cavalryman approached with a squad of
convalescents captured at the hospital. Jones allowed
him to come within close range and then raised his rifle.
The Yankee shouted to him: "Don't shoot," but his purpose
was not to be changed and his victim dropped from
the saddle. Reloading his rifle and changing his position
to another street a second squad of prisoners came by
and again his rifle brought down its game. Reloading the
third time he intercepted a platoon of cavalry and fired
into it, wounding two of them. They captured him, shot
him to death and then beat out his brains with the butts
of their rifles. He doubtless anticipated such a fate and
went coolly to certain death with no hope of fame and
with only the satisfaction of getting two for one.</p>

<p>Geo. Daniel, a Confederate quartermaster, chanced to
be at home on furlough in Covington on the same day.
He had been out bird hunting that morning and on his
return was captured by the Yankees, who enraged by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the killing of two of their men by Jones, determined to
shoot Daniel simply because he was found with a gun in
his hand. His protest that he was out for no hostile purpose
availed him nothing. He was ordered to face his
executioners and an effort was made to bind a handkerchief
over his eyes. He drew it away and said, "No, a
Confederate soldier can face death without being blindfolded."
The rifles rang out and he fell, another victim to
the humane influence of Northern civilization.</p>


<h3>A BRAVE CAROLINA MAIDEN.</h3>

<p>During my stay at the Oxford hospital a number of
ladies who had refugeed from Charleston, So. Ca., were
making their home in the village. Among them was a
Miss Fair, a beautiful girl with a wealth of wavy brown
hair. An ardent Southerner and anxious to benefit the
cause she loved, she had determined to visit Sherman's
army around Atlanta as a spy, bringing out such information
as she would be able to procure.</p>

<p>The raven locks were sacrificed, the face
and hands were died, a cracker bonnet and
homespun dress were donned and supplied with
a basket of parched ground peas she tramped around the
Federal camps, keeping her eyes and ears open. Making
the trip safely, she returned to Oxford and mailed a letter
to Gov. Brown, giving him the information she had
obtained as to Sherman's force and plans. When Garrard's
division entered Oxford, this letter was in the post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
office and was captured with other mail matter. It was
read by the raiders after they left the town and a squad
was sent back to search for the fair writer, but fortunately
she was securely hidden in the attic of Mr. River's
home, while her father was concealed in a well on the
premises. Few braver acts have been recorded of grim
visaged warriors than the daring feat accomplished by
this fair-faced daughter of the South.</p>


<h3>A GEORGIA "HOSS."</h3>

<p>While the raiders were in possession of the town, one
of them belonging to a Michigan regiment rode up to
the gate of the home where this girl was staying. The
lady of the house was sitting on the porch and the cavalryman
saluted her with the remark, "See what a fine
Georgia "hoss" I have." "Yes," she replied, "one you
stole I suppose." Turning to her ten-year-old son standing
by the soldier said, "Here, boy, hold this "hoss."
"I'd see you at the d&mdash;l first," replied the little Confederate.
This boy, now a middle-aged man, tells me that
it was his first and last use of improper language in the
presence of his Christian mother, and that for some reason
she failed on that occasion to administer even a mild
reproof.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>NASHVILLE CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>As we marched more than 800 miles in this campaign,
and as a record of these movements would probably interest
only my old comrades, the general reader has my
cheerful permission to skip the following condensed extracts
from my journal and to turn his or her attention
to the special incidents which succeed them. On Sept. 8,
'64, two days after the enemy had abandoned our front
at Lovejoy Station, we moved up to a position one mile
above Jonesboro, remaining there ten days. On the 18th
we moved to Fairburn and on the 19th to Palmetto,
where we fortified our position and remained until the
29th. Gen. Mercer having been assigned to another field
of duty, Gen. Smith, on the 25th, assumed command of
our brigade. On the 26th President Davis reviewed the
army and on the 28th Gen. Hardee, having asked to be
relieved, took leave of his old corps and Gen. Cheatham
was made corps commander. On the 29th we began our
northward march for the purpose of destroying Sherman's
line of communication, passing by easy stages of
ten to twenty miles a day, over the ground we had traversed
in the recent campaign and reaching the vicinity
of Dalton, Ga., on Oct. 13th. Here we destroyed three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
miles of railroad track, burning the cross-ties and bending
the rails by laying them across the burning ties and
twisting them around the trees that stood near the track.
After capturing the garrisons at Dalton and Tilton, and
tearing up a section of the E. T. &amp; Ga. R. R., we left on
the 14th for Gadsden, Ala., en route to Nashville. Hood
had decided to abandon the plan of campaign mapped
out by President Davis and himself and to advance into
Tennessee.</p>

<p>Passing through Villanow, Lafayette, Alpine and Blue
Pond, we arrived at Gadsden Oct. 20th. Resting here a
day we are off again and for four days are tramping
over the arid stretches of Sand Mountain, reaching the
vicinity of Decatur, Ala., on the evening of the 26th. My
journal for that day has this entry: "March delayed by
bridge falling in. Very muddy tramp after nightfall.
Slept under a corn crib." Two days later it has this entry:
"Two ears of corn issued to each man as rations."</p>

<p>Decatur was occupied by a Federal force and after
some skirmishing on the 27th and 28th we resumed our
march, passing through Courtland on the 30th, Tuscumbia
on the 31st and camping near the Tennessee river on
the evening of that day. Here we remained until Nov.
13th, when we crossed the river on a pontoon bridge and
camped near Florence. On the 14th we fortified our position
and on the 19th Hood began his march to intercept
Schofield in his effort to unite with Thomas at Nashville.
Our brigade was detached to ferry the wagon train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
across the river and on the 20th we tramped 12 or 14
miles through a driving snowstorm in a bitterly cold
wind to reach Cheatham's Ferry. I recall the fact that my
face became so thoroughly chilled that the snow that fell
on it failed to melt. After a week's work at the ferry, we
left on the 28th in charge of the wagon train to rejoin
our command. On Dec. 1st we struck the Nashville turnpike
and on the 2d received our first information of the
battle of Franklin, which had occurred Nov. 30, and in
which our division had suffered so heavily. Passing
through Columbia and Spring Hill on the 3d and Franklin
and the battle ground in its front on the 4th we rejoined
our division near Nashville on the 5th. Next day
the Oglethorpes were on the picket line, were relieved
on the 7th and on the 8th our brigade was ordered to
report to Gen. Forrest near Murfreesboro. Under Forrest's
direction the 9th and 10th were spent in tearing up
railroad track encased in snow and sleet, terribly cold
work.</p>

<p>Two days' rest with the thermometer at 9 degrees and
on the 13th we are again destroying railroad track near
Lavergne. On the morning of the 15th our brigade and
Palmer's started out under Forrest to capture a Federal
supply train. Fording Stone river and marching 10 or 12
miles in the direction of Murfreesboro Forrest is halted
by an order from Hood to hold himself in readiness to
go to his aid, as the battle of Nashville was in progress.
Next day we moved back to the Nashville turnpike to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
await the issue at Nashville. During the night Forrest
received news of Hood's defeat and with it orders to
form a junction with the retreating army at Columbia.</p>

<p>As the details of our march to that point, of our assignment
to the rear guard and of the retreat to Corinth,
Miss., will be given in succeeding sketches, it is unnecessary
to duplicate them here.</p>


<h3>A CHRISTMAS DAY WITH FORREST.</h3>

<p>It was the winter of '64, and to those of us who wore the
grey it was likewise the "winter of our discontent." The
hopes of the Confederacy were on the wane. The clouds
that hung above it had no silver lining, free or otherwise.
Sherman was "marching through Georgia," leaving in
his wake the ashes of many a Southern home. Hood's
reckless raid on Nashville had ended in disaster and his
ragged battalions were making tracks for the Tennessee
river, (some of them with bare feet) at a quickstep known
to Confederate tactics as "double distance on half rations."
The morale of the army was shattered if not destroyed.
If the soliloquy of a gaunt Tennesseean as he
rose from a fall in the mud on the retreat fairly represented
the sentiment of his comrades, it was badly shattered.
He is reported to have said: "Ain't we in a &mdash;&mdash;
of a fix, a one-eyed president, a one-legged general and
a one-horse Confederacy."</p>

<p>The Oglethorpes had fortunately escaped the butchery
at Franklin against which Forrest had so strongly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
protested. As this immunity was due to our having been
detained with Smith's brigade to ferry a salt train across
the Tennessee river, salt had literally "saved our bacon."</p>

<p>After rejoining the army, we had been again detached
to operate under Forrest near Murfreesboro and in this
way had missed the rout at Nashville. Aside from these
immunities the campaign had been one of exceptional
hardships. The weather was bitterly cold and our wardrobes
were not excessively heavy. The writer wore a
thin fatigue jacket, with no overcoat and slept under a
single blanket with the thermometer at nine degrees
above zero. For a week prior to the retreat we had been
engaged in the pleasant pastime of handling with ungloved
hands, railroad ties and rails encased in sleet and
snow. In addition to these hardships our commissary
department was but illy supplied. And yet I cannot recall
a single complaint made by a soldier during that campaign.
It is my deliberate conviction, based upon this and
similar evidence, that the Confederate soldier fought
harder on shorter rations and grumbled less under greater
privations than any soldier in history. The battle of
Nashville opened on the morning of December 15th and
for two days, thirty miles away, we listened to the thunder
of the artillery and anxiously awaited the issue. At
1 a. m. Dec. 17th we were aroused to begin the longest,
hardest forced march of our four years' service. Columbia,
the point of junction with Hood's retreating army,
is sixty miles away and we have to make it in forty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
hours or run the risk of almost certain capture by a force
ten times our own. It is cold, dark and raining&mdash;a dreary
combination. The roads are a mass of mud and before
we have tramped a mile one of my shoe strings breaks,
leaving the shoe imbedded six inches deep in the yielding
soil. Fishing it out, I resume the march with one
bare foot, but the rocks in the mud cut and bruise it at
every step and I am forced to stop for repairs. Taking the
strap from my rolled blanket, slits are cut in the flaps of
the shoe, the strap is buckled around so as to hold it in
place, and I hurry forward to rejoin my command. For
twenty-one hours we plow wearily through the mud,
camping at 10 p. m. after marching 35 miles. Dr. McIntyre,
in one of his Lyceum lectures, says that he had
no proper appreciation of either absolute silence or absolute
darkness until he stood within the central chamber
of the Wyandotte cavern. If he had tramped with
Forrest that winter day he would probably have added
to his experience an adequate conception of absolute
fatigue.</p>

<p>Five hours' rest and we are again on the march, but
with slower step, for the strain of the previous day has
told on the boys. In the early morning we halt to rest
and I breakfast on an ear of corn picked up by the roadside,
smearing it with black grease scraped from the bottom
of my frying pan. About midday Forrest dismounts
a number of his cavalry and gives up his own horse for a
time to help the "barefoot" brigade along. By 10 p. m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
we have made 25 miles and are completely fagged. Only
five of the thirty Oglethorpes reach camp that night,
Dick Morris, the writer, and three others whose names
I do not recall. Dick is short-limbed, but he has the grit
and the habit of getting there. On reaching Columbia
we are assigned to the rear guard under Forrest and
Walthall, who are instructed by Hood to sacrifice every
man in the command if necessary to ensure the safety of
his army. Manning trenches half filled with snow and
holding the enemy in check for a few days so as to give
Hood a fair start in the race, we begin our retreat Dec.
22 and on Christmas Eve camp near Pulaski, Tenn.
Coiled up in a single blanket on the cold, bare ground,
no visions of Santa Claus nor hopes of a Christmas menu
on the morrow brighten our dreams.</p>

<p>Early Christmas morning we are gathered around the
camp fire awaiting orders to march. Frank Stone, tall and
thin, so thin that Charlie Goetchius had advised him always
to present a side view to the enemy, as a minie ball
would never reach his anatomy in that position, ambles
up on a horse he had secured from one of the cavalry.
Frank had tried manfully to keep up with the procession.
Half sick, his shoes worn soleless and his feet lacerated
and bleeding, he had marched when every step was
agony and had crawled over the rocky portions of the
road on his hands and knees until human nature could
endure no more. Fortunately one of Forrest's cavalry
gave him a lift that saved him from a Northern prison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Frank had no saddle and to supply that need the boys
had piled his steed with blankets to a depth of five or
six inches. As he rode up his eye fell on a lot of cooking
utensils that had to be left for lack of transportation, and
turning to Will Daniel he said, "Lieutenant, hadn't I
better take along some of these?" Gen. Forrest was
standing a few feet away, grave and silent. Attracted by
Frank's question, he turned and inspecting the blanket
outfit for a moment he said, "I think you've got a &mdash;&mdash;
sight more now than you're entitled to." Frank made no
reply, but the criticism was thoroughly unjust for no
truer, braver soldier wore the grey.</p>

<p>The bugle sounds and we are again on the march.
About midday we halt on the summit of a ridge with an
old line of breastworks skirting its crest. Glad to have a
rest we adjust ourselves to take advantage of the respite,
when the ominous "Fall in," "Fall in" comes down the
line. The ranks are hastily formed, the trenches are manned
and Morton's battery is planted a short distance in
their rear and commanding the road. Our regiment is
placed as a support for the battery and as we line up,
Forrest passes us on foot going to the front in a half
bent position. Reaching the trenches he watches the advance
of the enemy for a few minutes and then hurries
to the rear. In a moment we hear the clatter of a horse's
feet and the "Wizard of the Saddle" dashes by at half
speed, riding magnificently, his martial figure as straight
as an arrow and looking six inches taller than his wont, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
very god of war, yelling as he reaches the waiting ranks:
"Charge!" "Charge!" "CHARGE!" Over the breastworks
flashes a line of grey and down the slope they
sweep, yelling at every step. The captain commanding
our regiment is undecided as to his duty, but finally orders
us to retain our position in the rear of the battery.
Just then Gen. Featherston rides up, "What regiment is
this?" "63rd Ga." "What are you doing here?" "Supporting
this battery." "Battery the d&mdash;l. Get over them
breastworks and get quick," and we "get." But the skirmish
is soon over. The Yankees have fled, leaving a
piece of artillery and a number of horses in our possession.</p>

<p>We hold our position until late in the afternoon, when
"Red" Jackson, with his cavalry, relieves us and we resume
the march. As we are filing off the enemy reappears
and the cavalry carbines are waking the echoes.
We are directly in the line of fire and the hiss of the minies
does not make pleasant music to march by. But Jackson
repels the attack and we have no further trouble with
our friends, the enemy. Night comes on and if there was
ever a darker or more starless one I can not place it.
Tramping, tramping in the cold and mud and darkness,
companies and regiments are all commingled and no
one knows where he is, or where he ought to be. Too
dark to see the file next in front, we walk by faith and
not by sight. Elmore Dunbar was carrying the colors
and but for his occasional whistling imitation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
bugle call in order to let us know "where he was at," our
regiment would have lost in the darkness all semblance
of its organization. I can not well conceive how a larger
share of unadulterated physical comfort could have
been compressed into the five solid hours for which we
kept it up.</p>

<p>At 11 p. m. we are ordered to halt, and camp near
Sugar Creek. The sound never was more welcome, nor
fell more sweetly on our ears than on that Christmas
night. Dinnerless and supperless and completely worn
out we hailed it with almost rapture for it brought the
promise of rest and sleep. Of all the Christmas days
that have come to me in life, only this stands out in
gloomy prominence as utterly wanting in every element
of the season's cheer and gladness. Yet looking backward
through the mists of more than thirty years, recalling
all its dangers and discomforts, its toil and weariness
and hunger, I would not if I could blot that day's record
from my memory, for o'er its somber shadows fell and
falls today the light that comes to every true heart in the
path of duty; while gilding all its gloom there comes
across the waste of years a vision of the knightly Forrest,
the bravest of the brave, for as he rode the lines that day,
the light of battle in his eye and the thunderous
"Charge!" upon his lips he rode into my heart as well,
the impersonation of chivalry, and rides there still.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h3>CLOSING DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.</h3>

<p>Early on the morning of the 26th the Federal cavalry
came within range of our camp during a dense fog. A
volley scattered them and our cavalry drove them back
for two miles.</p>

<p>Holding our position for two hours, and no further
advance being made by the enemy, we resumed the
march, camping at night near Lexington. A march of 12
miles on the 27th brought us to the Tennessee river,
which had already been crossed by Hood with his army
and wagon train. During the night, in expectation of an
attack by the enemy, we were moved into a line of
breastworks which had been vacated by Loring's division,
but we had seen the last of our blue-coated friends
for that campaign. Crossing the river on the 28th we
found on its Southern bank and near the end of the pontoon
bridge, 10 or 12 dead mules, and among them three
or four grey specimens of that much abused animal. I
had heard when a boy that a grey mule never died, that
they were gifted with a sort of equine immortality. And
now this dogma of my early days found its complete
subversion, for these were not only dead, but as Gen.
Jno. C. Brown said to us in North Carolina afterwards,
when asked as to President Lincoln's death, they were
"very dead." Unable to resist the force of this absolute
demonstration of the fact, I have always believed since
that a grey mule could die, though if further personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
evidence were demanded I would be unable to produce
it.</p>

<p>After crossing the river and without stopping to
hold a post-mortem examination on these faithful animals,
who robed in grey had died in the cause, we set out
to rejoin our division at Corinth, Miss. Passing through
Tuscumbia Bartow and Cherokee, we reached Birnsville,
Miss., on the evening of Dec. 31st. Here in the
waning hours of the dying year, after tramping eight
hundred miles in absolute health I lay down and had an
old-fashioned Burke county chill. Lying by a log-heap
fire through the long watches of the winter night, my
changes of base in the effort to keep the chilly side of
my body next to the blazing logs were almost continuous.
My old comrade Joe Warren, whose stalwart frame
in company with Jim Thomas, Bill Jones and Eph
Thompson graced the leading "file of fours" in this campaign
was wont to say that a certain brand of whiskey
had "a bad far'well." So the closing year had for the
writer at least "a bad far'well." The New Year found me
unable to travel. Lying over until Jan. 2d, in company
with several other invalids, I secured a seat on top of a
dilapidated box car. We had ridden only a mile, when
the conductor fearing the concern would collapse and
kill us all, kindly invited us to step down and out. Complying
with some degree of reluctance I shouldered my
gun and after a tramp of fifteen miles rejoined my command
at Corinth, Miss., where the shattered remnant of
Hood's army had gathered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<h3>SOME INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGN.<br />

"GO OFF AND WASH YOURSELVES."</h3>

<p>After the death of Gen. W. H. T. Walker, in July,
'64, our brigade was assigned to Pat Cleburne's division.
In his younger days he had served in the English army
and had probably imbibed his ideas of military discipline
from that service. On Sept. 26, '64, near Jonesboro, Ga.,
the army was reviewed by President Davis and in the
afternoon of that day our regiment was ordered to appear
at Cleburne's headquarters for inspection. The men
had received no intimation of the order and some of
the companies were not in a very cleanly condition either
as to dress or arms. Soap was scarce and but little time
had been spent on their toilets. The inspection proceeded
without comment from Cleburne until the company commanded
by Capt. Joe Polhill of Louisville, Ga., was
reached. Cleburne looked over the ranks with his keen
Irish eyes as Capt. Dixon inspected the arms, and then
in a tone indicating some degree of disgust, said, "Attention
company! Shoulder arms. Close order, march.
Right face. Forward by file right&mdash;march. Go off and
wash yourselves," and the regiment was ordered back
to its quarters. Will Daniel, jealous of the reputation of
the Oglethorpes, who had not been inspected, addressed
a note to Gen. Cleburne protesting against the implied
reflection on his company, to which the General replied
that no reflection was intended where no inspection was
made. In justice to Capt. Polhill and his company it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
only proper to say that at a subsequent inspection next
day they redeemed their reputation.</p>


<h3>PARTING WITH HARDEE.</h3>

<p>On the displacement of Gen. Johnston in July, 64,
Gen. Hardee, as the ranking lieutenant general in the
Army of Tennessee, felt aggrieved at the promotion of
Gen. Hood above him, but was too patriotic to ask for
an assignment to other fields while his lines were facing
the enemy. At the close of the campaign he did prefer
this request and on Sept. 28 took leave of his old corps.
Many of them had followed him from Shiloh to Jonesboro.
His almost unbroken success as brigade, division
and corps commander had given him the title of the
"Old Reliable." Even at Missionary Ridge his corps
held its line and on a portion of it, at the suggestion of
Gen. Alfred Cumming, made a counter charge, driving
the enemy from their front. At Ringgold Gap and in
every assault upon his lines during the Dalton and Atlanta
Campaign Hardee had repulsed the attacking column,
with the single exception of Jonesboro, where ten
lines of battle had been massed against Govan's thinly
manned trenches. For these reasons his old corps was
loth to give him up. On the evening before his departure
large numbers of his command went over to bid
him good-bye. In a simple and touching address he expressed
his deep regret at parting from those with whom
he had been associated so long, but said that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
be with them in spirit if not in person and hoped they
would always sustain the reputation they had so gallantly
won. "I leave you," said he, "but I leave you in good
hands, Frank Cheatham's. Frank and Pat go well together.
If Frank fails you, you have Pat to fall back
upon." Just then a soldier, who had climbed a tree and
was sitting on a limb 20 feet from the ground, sang out,
"Yes, General, and Crazy Bill ain't far off," alluding to
Gen. Bate. The scene was a very affecting one and after
speeches by Gen. Gist and Gen. Capers of So. Ca., closed
with appropriate music rendered by the band.</p>


<h3>GEN. BATE AS A POET AND WIT.</h3>

<p>The allusion to Gen. Bate in the preceding incident
recalls an address made by him Oct. 21, '64, at Gadsden,
Ala., where we had halted for a day on our trip to Nashville.
On the evening of that day the officers were serenaded
by the army bands and responses were made by
Beauregard, Cleburne, Clayton and Bate. The last sparkled
with eloquence and wit and was the gem of the evening.
Gov. Brown of Georgia, had issued an order exempting
a goodly number of citizens of conscript age in each
county from military service for the purpose of raising
provisions for the army, sorghum being named as one
of the products to be so used. This order had created a
feeling of resentment in the minds of those at the front
and Gen. Bate, in voicing this sentiment, and in criticism
of Gov. Brown's action, impromptued the following
parody on Campbell's downfall of Poland:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What tho' destruction sweep these lovely plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cares for liberty while sorghum yet remains?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that sweet name we wave our knives on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swear to cut it while we live and suck it till we die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gen. Bate's bravery as an officer equalled his wit as
a speaker, but his division had been unfortunate in several
engagements and other troops were disposed to guy
it, saluting it as it passed them with, "Lie down Bate, we
are gwine to bust a cap" or "scorch a feather," and such
like sallies of so-called wit. Our regiment had indulged
in this pastime to some extent and this fact seems to
have come to the knowledge of the General. At the battle
of Bentonville in March, '65, we were assigned to
Bates' corps. In the early morning an assault was made
on Govan's brigade, on our immediate left, and as we
were without breastworks we were ordered to lie down.
As we had not been on the firing line for some time and
the whistle of the minies had grown a little unfamiliar,
we obeyed the order very promptly, lying as flat as possible
without imbedding ourselves in the ground, and in
the case of Frank Stone and the writer this was pretty
flat. Gen. Bate rode up to our line and asked, "What
command is this?" "63rd Ga.," was the reply. "Why,
boys, you lie mighty close. I came very near riding over
you without seeing you. Never tell Bate to lie down any
more," and we didn't.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h3>PAT CLEBURNE AS AN ORATOR.</h3>

<p>Gen. Cleburne was a better fighter than speaker, and
yet his oratory was sometimes very effective. Of his address
on the occasion above referred to I recall but a
single sentiment uttered by him. After referring to the
outrages committed by Northern troops on Southern soil
he said, "I am not fighting for right, I am fighting for
vengeance." Of another address delivered by him on
the same day I retain a more vivid recollection. Two
soldiers of our brigade had appropriated a hog belonging
to some citizen living near Gadsden, and the matter
was reported to Gen. Cleburne. The brigade was ordered
out and formed into a hollow square facing inwards.
The two culprits were brought in under guard and
placed in the center of the square and then Cleburne and
his staff rode in. With the culprits before him and in
the presence and hearing of the entire brigade he for
fifteen minutes abused and demeaned and shamed them
until I think they were thoroughly reformed on that particular
line of moral depravity. On the march, some days
later, the road we were traveling changed direction
abruptly to the right. A corn field lay on that side and
a number of the boys, with the view of shortening their
tramp that day, leaped the fence and took the hypotenuse
of the triangle rather than walk the longer distance
represented by the other two sides. Gen. Cleburne, who
was riding at the head of the division, probably suspected
such a result and when he had reached the corner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the field where they would come out he stopped his horse
and quietly awaited their coming. As they reached the
road, singly or in pairs, the General gave them a brief
but pointed lecture on the sin of straggling, and to impress
it more forcibly on their memories he told them
in his suave Irish way that they could each take a rail
from the fence and carry it on their shoulders for the
next half mile. It was a new, but not a pleasant form of
traveling by rail. If my memory is not at fault one of the
Oglethorpes had the honor of membership in the rail
squad that day, and probably has still a feeling recollection
of the incident. He was something of a vocalist in
those days and was wont to enliven the march with the
tender strains of "Faded Flowers," "The Midnight
Train," "Benny Havens Ho," and other popular musical
selections, but on that day his lyre was voiceless and
all its music hushed.</p>


<h3>HOOD'S STRATEGY.</h3>

<p>This incident has no reference to Gen. John B. Hood,
whose strategy in this campaign was apparently conspicuous
only by its absence. It refers only to Private
Hood of the Oglethorpes, who joined our ranks in '63
or '64, probably at Thunderbolt. As I recall his personality,
he was an undergrown youth of sallow complexion
and uncertain age. On our march to Nashville he grew
sick or tired, and stopped at the home of a citizen to recuperate.
Some days later a squad of Yankee soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
stopped at the house, and Hood, deeming prudence the
better part of valor, dropped his grey uniform and donning
a suit belonging to the son of his host, passed himself
off as a member of the family. While chatting with
the visitors one of them said to him, "Well, Bud, haven't
they got you in the army yet?" "No, sir," said Hood,
"and they ain't agoing to either." "That's right, my boy,"
and with Hood's assurance that he had no idea of "jining,"
they bade him good-bye and went their way. Some
weeks later he rejoined us, congratulating himself on the
success of his strategy.</p>


<h3>A LUCKY FIND.</h3>

<p>While ferrying the army train across the Tennessee
river, the flat in charge of Sergeant S. C. Foreman of the
Oglethorpes, brought in a box or case containing three
hundred pounds of nice dry salted bacon. It was reported
to me that they had found it floating down the river and
supposed it had been thrown in by the Federal garrison
at Florence to prevent its capture by Hood's army. I
swallowed the story and some of the meat and had no
occasion to question the correctness of the information
until Sam Woods told me in '98 that he found it lying in
shallow water near the river bank, and George McLaughlin
afterwards intimated that it was stolen from
the wagon train. Whatever may have been the method
by which it came into our possession I remember that it
was divided among the members of the company as ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>tra
rations. I recall the further fact that my mess secured
that afternoon a large wash pot and a supply of corn
and boiled up a peck or two of "lye hominy." On the
next day we began our march to rejoin the army and
for 17 miles, in addition to my gun, bayonet, cartridge
box and forty rounds of cartridges, heavy blanket, tent
fly and haversack with two day's rations, I carried 6
or 8 pounds of this bacon and a bucket of the hominy.
The aggregate weight must have been 50 or 60 pounds,
a pretty fair load for a "light weight."</p>


<h3>"WHO ATE THE DOG."</h3>

<p>This inquiry, while not invested with the same degree
of mystery, nor enjoying as large a measure of notoriety
as "Who struck Billy Patterson?" nevertheless
echoed on many a hillside and enlivened many a camp
fire on our trip to Nashville. The incident which gave
rise to it occurred soon after we left the Tennessee river
on this ill-fated tramp. To prevent depredations upon
the property of citizens along the route of our march, a
provost guard had been formed, in command of which
was placed an officer now living not a thousand miles
from Augusta, but who shall be nameless here, partly
out of respect to his feelings and partly out of regard for
my own. He has warned me that a different course would
be followed by an aggravated case of assault and battery
and I do not care to put the courts to unnecessary
expense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Stringent orders were issued by Gen. Smith to arrest
any man found in possession of fresh meat, for which he
could give no satisfactory account. Several arrests had
been made and the captured meat had been confiscated
and appropriated by the provost guard to their own use,
benefit and behoof. To the men engaged in these depredations,
justified in their eyes by the shortness of their
rations, these captures became a little monotonous and
they determined to find some means of retaliation. One
day a soldier was seen tramping through the woods with
a suspicious looking sack swinging from his shoulder
and one of the guard ordered him to halt. Instead of
obeying the command he gave leg bail and the guard
started in pursuit.</p>

<p>The forager encumbered with the weight of
his plunder finally dropped it and made his escape. The
sack was found to contain, apparently, a leg of mutton
nicely dressed, which was turned over to the officer in
command.</p>

<p>In view of this tempting addition to the bill of fare, a
brother officer, who has since turned his sword into a
spatula and is as well versed now in drugs as he was then
in tactics, was an invited guest at the midday meal that
day. Ample justice was done to the menu by all concerned
and all went merry as a marriage bell until the
command had halted for the night and the men, wearied
by the day's march, were resting around their camp fires.
And then a change came o'er the spirit of their dream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
From one end of the camp, up through the stillness of
the evening air, there rose a cry, that like of noise of
many waters, rang and reverberated to its farthest
bounds, "Who ate the dog?" And as its echoes died
away, from another camp fire in the same stentorian
tones there came the answer, "Lieut &mdash;&mdash;," naming
the officer of the provost guard. And on through the
entire evening, at brief intervals and without the stimulus
of an encore the program was repeated. And now as
there flitted across the mental vision of the officer aforesaid
the memory of the mutton chops that had seemed so
savory and toothsome, there came to him a dim suspicion
that he had been the victim of misplaced confidence.
Was it mutton or was it dog? As he debated the
question pro and con, he was forced to admit with
Shakespeare that "all that glitters is not gold," and with
Longfellow, that "things are not what they seem," and
with Whittier that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all sad thoughts of tongue or pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The saddest are these, it might have been"&mdash;a dog.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now if the spirit of Poe will pardon me,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All this dark and dread suspicion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such canine deglutition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it crossed his mental vision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading not to height elysian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made him sad and made him sadder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made him mad and made him madder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his soul from out its shadow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be lifted, nevermore.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></div></div>

<p>For weeks and months, and indeed until the war closed,
this canine ghost would never down. He was not allowed
to forget it. He was taunted and barked at and
dogged so constantly that no Lethean waters could wash
out the maddening memory. And the bitterness of it all
was that the perpetrators of the joke would give no intimation
as to the special breed that graced his table that
winter day, whether</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mongrel, puppy, whelp or hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cur of low degree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The size of the ham precluded the possibility of its
having been a bench-legged fice, but there was the torturing
reflection that it might have been what Mark
Twain has termed the Ishmael of his race, the "yaller
dog," who if Mark is to be credited, has been "cursed in
all his generations and relations in his kindred by consanguinity
and affinity and in his heirs and assigns&mdash;cursed
with endless hunger with perpetual fear with
perennial laziness with hopeless mange, with incessant
fleas and with his tail between his legs."</p>

<p>These unpleasant reflections were, however, not confined
to the officer in command of the provost guard. A
part of the meat had been sent to brigade headquarters
and it was said that an aide on the general's staff, who
had eaten very freely of the dish, suffered on learning of
its origin so serious a gastric disturbance that he vom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>ited,
as a colored brother once put it, from Genesis to
Revelations.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know not how the truth may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell the tale as 'twas told to me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Regretting my inability, for reasons already stated, to
answer this inquiry more definitely, I can only say in
conclusion as I heard Bob Toombs once say in another
connection, "In spite of compromises, concessions and
constitutions this question still marches onward for its
solution," who ate the dog?</p>


<h3>WHERE IS THE OVEN?</h3>

<p>Army life is not specially conducive to personal cleanliness,
nor to a high regard for the minor proprieties of
life. A young lady visiting Camp McKenzie, near Augusta,
Ga., during the Spanish-American war, was shocked
by seeing a soldier drop a piece of bread upon the
ground and after picking it up resume its mastication.
If this sketch should meet her eye, that feeling will
probably be reawakened and intensified:</p>

<p>During the later years of the Confederate war wash
basins in camp were an unknown quantity. The morning
ablution, if performed at all, was managed by pouring
water on the hands from a canteen. Lieut. Blanchard,
I remember, always held his hands in cup shape until
they were filled and then dropped one, spilling all the
liquid and washing his face with the moistened palm of
the other. In the bitter cold and constant marching of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the Nashville campaign I am satisfied that some of the
boys did not wash their faces nor comb their hair at less
than weekly intervals. As evidence of the infrequency of
"bath tub nights" for reasons stated, I recall the fact
that I lost a calico handkerchief and thought I had dropped
it on the march. Some weeks afterwards in removing
my outer clothing for the first time after its disappearance,
I found it hidden away underneath the back of
my vest. On our return to Corinth, Miss., my mess took
their underclothing to a lady to be washed and as they
had been wearing it a month or more without change,
they apologized for its condition. "No apology is necessary,"
she said, "I have washed some for Forrest's cavalry
that was so stiffened with dirt that they were able to
stand alone."</p>

<p>How we managed to keep our pedal extremities in a
cleanly condition I do not recall save in a single instance
and this, it is perhaps not amiss to say, was an exceptional
case and not a company custom. A member of
the Oglethorpes one day began his preparations for the
midday meal. One of the cooking utensils was missing
and he sang out, "Where is the oven?" A messmate
some distance away shouted back, "Can't you wait till
I finish washing my feet in it?" I am not prepared to testify
as to the flavor of the bread that day as fortunately,
I was not a member of that particular mess.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMENDE HONORABLE.</h3>

<p>It has been my purpose in these records
to present the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. It has not been
my purpose to do any wrong, express or implied,
to any member of either of the human or the canine
race. In justice therefore to the truth of history and to the
"yaller dog" as well, it is perhaps proper to say that since
penning the preceding "dog" sketch, an old comrade
has informed me that the "mutton (?) ham" to which
allusion was made in that sketch, had its origin in the
anatomy of a "brindle" dog and not of one, who as
Mark Twain says, "slinks through life in a diagonal dog
trot as if in doubt which end is entitled to the precedence."
My comrade claims to speak from personal
knowledge and not from hearsay testimony, and as his
statement has not been induced by the fear of punishment
or the hope of reward, its credibility can not be
impeached. He says that the dog in question had grown
old in the service of his master and on account of age
and meritorious service had been placed on the retired
list with full pay as to rations, personal care, etc.; that
in the enjoyment of the otium cum dignitate attendant
upon these conditions he had grown "fat" if not fair and
forty; that in an evil hour he was enticed away from
the retirement of his home and with malice aforethought
slaughtered in cold blood while his juicy hams were
nicely dressed to tickle the palates of the provost guard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>As the yaller dog has already had assigned to him as
many of the ills that flesh is heir to as he can reasonably
bear, it gives me pleasure to make this amende honorable
and to relieve him in this special instance of any
of the "white man's burden" even as an involuntary particeps
criminis in the transaction under consideration.
Before giving final dismissal to the subject it may not
be amiss to say for the benefit of the hospitable host and
the appreciative guest at that midday meal that if, as
physiologists contend, every atom of our physical organism
undergoes a complete metamorphosis in every
seven years of our existence, it should comfort them to
know that 28 years and seven months ago by exact calculation,
the last lingering trace of canine flavor in their
muscles, bones and blood and epidermis likewise had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gone glimmering through the dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of things that were, a schoolboy's tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonder of an hour.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>COURAGE SUBLIME.</h3>

<p>In concluding these reminiscences of the Nashville
campaign, a campaign so fraught with disaster to our
cause, I am glad to throw over them at their close the
glamour of an incident that in its display of infinite courage
gilds with its glory even the gloom of defeat. In a
subsequent sketch I shall have occasion to pay some
tribute to the conspicuous gallantry of the color-bearer
of the First Florida regiment in our last charge at Bentonville.
Under the inspiration of the "Rebel Yell" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the contagious enthusiasm and excitement of a charge
men may have made reputations for courage they would
not sustain when subjected to the test of "simply standing
and dying at ease." This man, however, George Register
by name, was tried in both furnaces and came out
pure gold.</p>

<p>The incident referred to occurred at the battle of
Franklin, Nov. 30, '64. The failure of a staff officer to
promptly deliver Hood's order to Cheatham at Spring
Hill had allowed Schofield to escape when the interposition
of a single division across his front would have resulted
in the capture of his army and would have ensured
the success of the campaign. And now the Federal
army lay at Franklin heavily entrenched while Hood,
fretting over the blunder, determined to retrieve it by
an assault upon their works. Forrest protested that it
would be a useless sacrifice of life, would probably end in
failure and offered to flank Schofield out of his position
in two hours if furnished a single division of infantry to
co-operate with his cavalry. Hood could not be argued
out of his purpose to fight and ordered his army into
line. Cleburne rode down his lines as his division filed
into position and passing an old friend, a captain in the
ranks, he noticed that he was barefooted and that his feet
were bleeding. Stopping and dismounting he asked the
captain to pull off his boots and then requested him to
try them on his own feet. In reply to the captain's protest
he said, "I am tired wearing boots and can do with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>out
them," and then he rode away to lead his last charge.
Gen. Granbury, commanding a Texas brigade in Cleburne's
division, rode out in front of his men and said,
"Boys, two hours work this evening will shorten the
war two years." Two hours later, on that short November
afternoon, the very flower of Hood's army lay
dead or dying in front of the Federal breastworks.
Among them lay Cleburne, Granbury, Adams, Gist,
Strahl and Carter, six general offices, a larger number
than fell in three day's fighting at Gettysburg, or any
battle field in the four years' struggle.</p>

<p>Under the murderous leaden hail that swept the open
field over which they passed, the First Florida Regiment
was ordered to lie down to secure some immunity
from the fire that was rapidly thinning their ranks. The
entire regiment sank to the ground, save one of their
number. The color-bearer, unwilling to lower his flag,
yet willing to show his foe how a brave man could die,
refused to avail himself of the partial protection which
a change in position would bring, and standing erect,
calmly faced the storm of shot and shell; faced it unmoved,
while seven of the eight color guards lying at his
feet were killed or wounded; faced it unflinchingly while
the staff he held in his brave right hand was three times
shattered by hostile shot; faced it without a tremor while
the folds of his tattered flag were thirty times rent and
torn by hissing minies or shrieking shell; faced it calmly
until the blessedness of night had come to end the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>nival
of death, and stood there at its close the very incarnation
of courage and yet without the smell of fire on
his garments or the mark of shot or shell on his grey-clad
form.</p>

<p>I know not whether he still survives. I know not
whether his radiant deed has found a fitting recognition
save in the memory of surviving comrades. But living
or dead, famous or forgotten, my hat goes off to you
today, George Register, in loving admiration of a
heroism that in soldierly devotion to the colors that you
bore, crowns you an immortal and rises to the region
of the morally sublime.</p>

<h3>THE CLOSING CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>A weeks' stay in the vicinity of Corinth, Miss., and orders
were received for the transfer of Stewart's and
Cheatham's corps to the East to aid Hardee in an effort
to prevent a junction of the armies of Grant and Sherman.</p>


<h3>AN ARCTIC RIDE.</h3>

<p>Transportation by rail was furnished only to the sick
and barefooted, who were ordered to report at Corinth
at daylight, Jan. 10th. Weakened by an attack of chill
and fever I joined the sick squad, which left camp at 1
a. m., tramped through the mud and rain, waded several
streams and reached Corinth in the early morning with
our clothing wet to our knees. In this condition, with no
opportunity to dry our drenched garments, we rode in a
box car without fire on a cold winter day from 8 a. m.
until 3 p. m. The car was crowded and the heating arrangements
were confined to such exercise as we could
take in the limited space we were forced to occupy. I had
never been taught to "trip the light fantastic toe" and
the figures I cut that day were more continuous than
graceful. At 3 p. m. I told the Oglethorpes, who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
with me, John Kirkpatrick and Will Dabney among
them, I remember, that while I was willing to die in a
soldierly way in battle, I did not propose to freeze to
death, and suggested that in order to secure an opportunity
to thaw, we stop at the next station, which chanced
to be Baldwin, Miss. The motion was carried unanimously,
though not by a rising vote, as we already occupied
from necessity a standing position, our car having
no furniture except a floor and a door. To give the
reader some gauge of the condition of the railroads in
that section at that stage of the war, it is only necessary
to say that we had traveled only 31 miles in 7 hours.
We were kindly received by a Mr. Kent, an old citizen
of Baldwin, who regretted his inability to furnish us anything
but shelter and fire, as he had been foraged upon
by Yankees and Confederates alike until there was very
little meal in the barrel or oil in the cruse and "no prophet
in all the land to bless the scanty store." When the
evening meal was ready, however, he came to our room
and with an apology to my comrades for failing to include
them in the invitation, he pressed the writer to
share his humble fare. Whether this discrimination in my
favor was due to my good looks, my winning ways or
the appearance of chronic hunger in my face, has remained
to this day an unsolved problem. And yet whatever
may have been the right solution, it gives me pleasure
through this humble record to waft back over the
waste of years my earnest appreciation of his kindness
to a sick and underfed Confederate.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h3>CLEANED UP FINANCIALLY.</h3>

<p>No train passed next morning and we tramped down
the railroad for 12 miles, stopping at Saltillo for the
night. None of us were well, the weather was cold and
to avoid sleeping on the damp, bare ground we began
to reconnoiter for better lodging. By reason possibly of
the favorable impression made by the writer on our host
at Baldwin, I was made spokesman for the occasion.
Knocking at the residence of a Mrs. B. I stated our condition
in as impressive language as I could command
and emphasized our desire to avoid the exposure of
sleeping on the cold, damp ground. To this she replied
that she was a widow, living there alone, that she knew
nothing of us, and that while she disliked to turn off Confederate
soldiers, she could not feel that it would be
proper or prudent for her to entertain a company of utter
strangers. "Well, madame," I replied, "I appreciate
your position and if you feel the slightest hesitancy, we
will not insist." "Walk in sir," she replied, "You can
stay." She told me afterwards that if I had pressed my
appeal she would have turned us away, but that my failure
to do so convinced her that we were gentlemen. It
may be as well to confess that I had anticipated such an
objection and had framed my reply to meet it.</p>

<p>During the evening she told us with quivering lips, of
the death of her soldier boy in Virginia, of her sad mission
in visiting the battle field to recover his body and
lay it away in the old family burying ground, and spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
so feelingly of her attachment to our cause that on retiring
to our room I remember that we entertained some
fears that an offer of compensation for our entertainment
might offend her. The sum total of our financial assets,
as I recollect it, was a $20 Confederate bill owned by
Will Dabney. On taking our leave next morning we tendered
it in payment of our bill, thinking, of course, that
she would decline it with thanks, but we had reckoned
without our host or at least without our hostess. She
accepted it with the remark that it would exactly square
the account, and we were turned out on the cold charity
of the world without a cent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas the last of our assets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone glimmering alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All its blue-backed companions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wasted and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bill of its kindred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor greenback was night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even a "shinplaster"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spend for pie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In justice to our kind-hearted hostess, and lest some
reader should imagine that her charges were really extravagant,
it is proper to say that she had given five
hungry soldiers a sumptuous supper and breakfast, had
lodged us on snowy feather beds and had accepted in
payment what was equivalent to one dollar or less in
good money. If the condition of our finances needs any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
explanation it may be found in the fact that our last pay
day had occurred just 12 months and ten days before.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But I am spinning out these little incidents at too
great length. Resuming our march we were overtaken
by our command and tramped with it to Tupelo, where
we remained 12 days. On January 25th we boarded the
cars for Meridian, but the train was overloaded and we
traveled only 18 miles in 12 hours, not very rapid transit.
In order to lighten the load two cars were detached and
in one of them Lieut. Goetchius and ten of the Oglethorpes,
including the writer chanced to be passengers.
After two days' tramp through the "Prairie Lands" of
Mississippi, our squad secured transportation, rejoining
our command at Meridian, Jan. 29. Thence by rail to
McDowell's Landing, by boat to Demopolis, by rail to
Selma and by boat to Montgomery, reaching that place
1 p. m., Feb. 1st. The preceding night was a very cold
one and as we were deck passengers and no heating
arrangements had been provided, a fire was built of fat
pine on a pile of railroad iron. Frank Lamar, I remember,
sat on the leeward side of the fire with the black
smoke pouring into his face all night, and next day
could have played the role of negro minstrel without the
use of burnt cork. The writer kept his temperature above
the freezing point by volunteering as an aid to the fireman
in the engine room.</p>

<p>Leaving Montgomery Feb. 2d, we reached Columbus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Ga., late in the afternoon and on our arrival were met
by a delegation of ladies, who greeted us with a speech,
a song and a supper. My journal, I regret to say, records
the fact that the supper was last but not least in the degree
of appreciation meted out to the trio by the boys.
Passing through Macon Feb. 3d, we arrived at Midway
at 2 a. m. of the 4th and remained there a day drawing
clothing and blankets. Leaving the railroad we marched
through Milledgeville on the 5th, but did not stop to investigate
the condition of Gov. Brown's "collard patch."
Reaching Mayfield on the 7th we boarded the cars again,
lay over at Camak and arrived at Augusta on the evening
of the 8th, the brigade going into camp near Hamburg
and the Oglethorpes remaining with friends and
relatives in the city.</p>


<h3>A SAD HOME-COMING.</h3>

<p>Sixteen miles away, embowered in a grove of oak and
elm, lay the home I had left, holding within the sacred
shadow of its walls all that I loved best on earth. For
nearly two months no tidings had come to me from
them. We had been so constantly on the move that the
letters written had never reached me. The latest message
received had told me of my father's illness, but its
tone gave me hope of his early recovery. Our passage
through Augusta gave me the privilege of revisiting the
old homestead, but it was a sad home-coming. Twice
since I had left it last the family circle had been broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and the shadow of death had fallen on its hearthstone.
A few short months before in the autumnal haze of a
September day, as sweet a sister as brother ever owned
had breathed out her young life just as she was budding
into womanhood. And now only a week before I entered
its portals again my father, worn out by the added burdens
imposed by the absorption of younger physicians
in the military service, had been laid away beneath the
shadow of the trees in the city of the dead. The reader
will pardon, I trust, the filial tribute to his worth that
comes unbidden from my heart today. Beyond and above
any partial judgment born of the love I bore him, I have
always thought him the best and purest man I have ever
known. It may be that no human life can claim perfection
and yet if his knew aught of fault or blemish in all
the years from boyhood to the grave, no human eye
could see it. In lofty purpose and in lowly, unremitting
faithfulness to duty he lived above the common plane of
men, serving his generation by the will of God, doing
justly, loving mercy, walking humbly in all the paths his
Master's feet had trod and dying in the noontide of his
usefulness, he left to those who loved him, a name as
pure and stainless as the snows that winter's breath have
heaped upon his grave.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After ten days' rest at home, in company with eight
comrades of the Oglethorpes, I left Augusta Feb. 20 to
rejoin my command in upper South Carolina, reaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
it after six days' tramp, near Pomaria. I recall only two
or three incidents of that trip, that are seemingly worthy
of record in these pages. The night of Feb. 21 was spent
near the residence of Mr. Johnson Bland, who kindly
sent to our bivouac an ample supply of edibles for our
evening meal. After they had been disposed of, the negro
messenger, who had brought the supplies, entertained
us with a learned disquisition on a species of ghosts,
which he termed "hanks." Harrison Foster, with his
usual taste for scientific research, wanted to know how
the presence of these hanks could be detected and was
informed that if in traveling at night he felt the sudden
touch of a warm breath of air on his face he might rest
assured that it was a "hank." Possibly to test the sincerity
of his conviction on the subject or to guard our
slumbers from the disturbing influence of an inroad of
these restless spirits of the night, Harrison gave the
negro a gun and posted him as a lone sentry in an adjacent
graveyard.</p>

<p>The next night was spent at the residence of Major
Dearing. The family were all away and Mr. Smith, who
had charge of the plantation, kindly gave us the use of
the dwelling for the night. It was very handsomely furnished
and to the credit of our squad I desire to record
the fact that while silver forks and spoons were lying
loosely around the dining room, not one of them disappeared
when we took our departure. There were no
Ben Butlers among us. Two nights later we slept in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Universalist church, said to be haunted, not by "hanks,"
but by the ghost of its former pastor, Mr. Stitch. My
journal records the further fact that on the evening before
we rejoined our command the entire squad suffered
from an aggravated attack of the "blues." In whatever
way the fact may be accounted for, there is but one other
similar entry for the four years' service. An hour or
two after reaching the camp of our regiment we began
the march for Chester, reaching that place March 5th.
Remaining there until the 10th we left by rail for Charlotte,
but by reason of an accident, failed to arrive at our
destination until the evening of the 11th. On the 12th
we moved on to Salisbury, remained there until the 17th,
when the train took us to Smithfield. A march of 16
miles on the 18th enabled us to rejoin our corps near
Bentonville.</p>


<h3>OUR LAST BATTLE.</h3>

<p>During the Confederate Reunion in Atlanta, Ga., in
'98, a man with kindly eyes and grizzled beard approached
me with extended hand and said, "Do you know me?"
His face seemed familiar, but I was forced to confess
that I could not exactly place him. "Do you know where
I saw you last?" I was compelled to admit that I was
still in the dark as to his identity. "Well," said he, "it
was behind the biggest kind of a pine." "Now I know
you, Sam Woods," said I. That pine supplied the missing
link in my memory and furnished likewise a link in
the present sketch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Our junction with Hardee's force had placed us again
under Joe Johnston&mdash;the same Joe whose displacement
at Atlanta had perhaps as much to do with the collapse
of the Confederacy as the failure of Pickett's charge at
Gettysburg, the Joe of whom Bill Arp said he would
walk ten miles on a rainy night to look into his hazel
eyes and feel the grip of his soldier hand&mdash;the Joe of
whom Capt. Picquet said, as he rode by us on his mettled
bay at the battle of Resaca, "Boys, I always feel
safer when that man is around"&mdash;the same Joe who,
when asked by Col. Geo. A. Gordon at Dalton how he
managed to manoeuver an army in the woods in battle,
replied, "Well, Colonel, I have to depend largely on my
corps commanders; they rely on the Major Generals,
who in turn depend on the brigadiers, the brigadiers on
the Colonels, the Colonels on the Captains, but," said
he, "thank God, we all have to rely on the private at
last."</p>

<p>By 10 a. m., March 19th, the day after our arrival at
Bentonville, we were in line of battle, fronting a large
part of Sherman's army. Our regiment depleted by sickness
and death and capture and possibly "French leave"
as we came through Georgia, had only a hundred men
in its ranks&mdash;the Oglethorpes only nineteen. We had no
field officer and, as I remember, only one captain, one
lieutenant and an orderly sergeant for the ten companies.
At one stage in the fight that followed the orderly sergeant
was the ranking officer in the regiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after taking our position, near the extreme right
of the line, an assault was made by the enemy and was
repulsed. About midday Gen. Bate, commanding our
corps, gave the order to advance. In our front and gently
sloping upwards for three hundred yards was an old field
dotted with second growth pines, and two hundred and
fifty yards beyond its highest point on the descending
slope lay the Federal breastworks awaiting us. Closing
in to the left as we advanced, we passed over the bodies
of the enemy who had been killed in the assault and
whose faces, from exposure to the sun, had turned almost
black. Reaching the top of the slope we came in
view of the Federal line and if our eyes had been closed
our ears would have given us ample evidence of the
fact. The rattle of the Enfields and the hiss of the minies
marked the renewal of our acquaintance with our old
antagonists of the Dalton and Atlanta campaign. Down
the slope we charged until half the distance had been
covered and the enemy's line is only a hundred yards
away. The "zips" of the minies get thicker and thicker
and the line partially demoralized by the heavy fire suddenly
halts. Frank Stone is carrying the colors (Cleburne's
division flag&mdash;a blue field with white circle in the
center) and he and I jump for the same pine. It is only
six inches thick and will cover neither of us fully, but we
divide its protective capacity fairly. Fifteen or twenty
feet to my left there is an exclamation of pain and as I
turn to look Jim Beasley clasps his hand to his face as
the blood spurts from his cheek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>My cartridge box has been drawn to the front of my
body for convenience in loading as well as for protection
and as I look to the front again a ball strikes it, and
strikes so hard that it forces from me an involuntary
grunt. Frank hears it and turns to me quickly, "Are you
hurt?" I said I believed not and proceed to investigate.
The ball passing through the leather and tin had struck
the leaden end of a cartridge and being in that way deflected
had passed out the right side of the box instead
of through my body. Thirty or forty feet to the right the
gallant color-bearer of the First Florida, whose heroism
at Franklin has already received notice in these records,
is making his way alone towards the breastworks at half
speed, with his flag held aloft, fifty yards in front of the
halted ranks. Inspired by his example or recovering from
the temporary panic, the line moves forward again, and
the enemy desert their breastworks and make for the
rear at a double-quick. Leaping the entrenchments, a
hatchet, frying pan and Enfield rifle lie right in my path.
Sticking the pan and hatchet in my belt, I drop my Austrian
gun and seizing the Enfield I see across the ravine
a group of the enemy running up the hill. Aiming at the
center of the squad I send one of their own balls after
them, but the cartridge is faulty and fails to reach its
mark. We pursue them for half a mile and the disordered
ranks are halted to be re-formed. Capt. Hanley, formerly
of Cleburne's staff, calls for volunteer skirmishers and
John Kirkpatrick is first to respond. Turning to me he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
says, "Come on Walter." The writer is not advertising for
that sort of a job, but the call is a personal one and
not caring to let the boys know how badly scared I am,
I step out of the ranks. Will Dabney, though laboring
under a presentiment that he was to be killed that day,
joins us, as do others whose names are not recalled.
Deploying and advancing through the woods we are
soon in range of the minies again. Lieut. Hunter, a little
to our left, is struck and tumbles forward on his head.
Will calls out to me that Hunter is killed, but he is mistaken.
The lieutenant regains his feet and finds that the
wound is confined to his canteen. Advancing further I
find a lady's gaiter and a glass preserve dish dropped by
the enemy and probably stolen from some Southern
home. Capt. Matt Hopkins, of Olmstead's regiment,
picks up a book similarly dropped, but does not carry it
long before a minie knocks it from his hand. The line of
battle follows in our wake but before it reaches us a ball
strikes John Miller, passing directly through his body,
and he turned to the color-bearer and said, "Frank, I'm
killed." Frank replied, "I hope not John." The line
presses on and John lies down under the pines to die.
In a little while Frank is disabled by a wound in the
side and turns the colors over to Billy Morris. The regiment
reaches the position occupied by the skirmish line
and under heavy fire we are ordered to lie down. Sam
Woods and the writer seek the shelter of a large pine
and while kneeling together behind it a minie passes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
through Sam's hand and thigh and he limps to the rear.
Advancing again, we are halted just before night by a
pond or lagoon in our front. A friendly log lies near its
edge and we lie down behind it. A Federal battery open
on us and the color-bearer of Olmstead's 1st Ga. regiment
is knocked six or eight feet and disemboweled by a
solid shot as it plows through the ranks. As the litter-bearers
are carrying off another wounded man from the
same regiment he begs piteously for his haversack,
which has been left behind. They are under fire and refuse
to halt. One of the Oglethorpes, in pity for the poor
fellow, leaves the protection of his log and running up
the line secures the haversack, takes it to him, then hastens
back to his position.</p>

<p>Night comes on, the firing ceases and the fight is ended.
We have driven the enemy more than a mile, have
captured a number of prisoners and have suffered comparatively
little loss. Of the 19 Oglethorpes only one has
been killed and three wounded, though thirteen others
bear on their bodies, clothing or equipment marks of
the enemy's fire, some of them in three or four places.
Frank Stone, in addition to the wound in his side and
a hole through his sleeve, has a chew of tobacco taken
off by a ball that passes through his pocket. John
Kirkpatrick has his canteen ventilated, Sol Foreman and
Will Dabney find the meal in their haversacks seasoned
with minies instead of salt, and the writer, in addition to
the demoralization of his cartridge box, finds a hole in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
his haversack and thirteen in his folded blanket, all
probably made by a single ball. Relieved from our position
in the line by Harrison's regiment, by the aid of
torches we find John Miller's body and near it a naked
arm taken off at the elbow by a cannon ball. Placing
them on a blanket, John Kirkpatrick, Will Dabney, the
writer and another comrade carry them nearly half a
mile to an open field and give them as decent burial as
we can.</p>

<p>War's casualties, alas, are not all counted on the battlefield.
From dread suspense that comes between the
battle and the published list of slain and wounded, from
the wearing agony of a separation that seems so endless,
and the weary watching for footsteps that never come
again, they fall on gentle hearts in lonely homes far removed
from the smoke and din of musketry and cannon,
not suddenly, perhaps, but sometimes just as surely
as if by deadly missile on the firing line. John was an
only child and far away in his Georgia home his stricken
parents rendered childless by his death, mourned in their
loneliness for "the touch of a vanished hand" until broken
hearted they, too, were laid away in the narrow-house
appointed for all the living.</p>

<p>On the following day the remainder of Sherman's
army came up and two divisions secured a position in
our rear, but were driven back. A regiment of Texas
cavalry made a successful charge in this engagement,
holding their bridle reins in their mouths and a navy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
pistol in each hand. A gallant son of Gen. Hardee went
in with them as a volunteer and was killed in the charge.
Our division was not engaged, there being only skirmishing
in our front. Harrison Foster and Billy Morris
were on the picket line and under a misapprehension of
an order of Gen. Bate, who was riding over the line with
his crutches strapped to his saddle, they advanced to a
point within close range of the Yankee trenches. Subjected
to a heavy fire, they took refuge behind a pile of
rails. While lying there Billy was struck in the face and
the pain of the wound led him to think that he was
severely hurt. An investigation, however, showed that a
minie ball had shattered a rail and had driven a splinter
into the flesh. There was renewed skirmishing on the
21st, but as a company our last gun had been fired.
Johnston, finding his force of less than 20,000 men too
small to cope with Sherman's entire army, evacuated his
position on the 22d and retired to the vicinity of Smithfield.
Here we remained until April 10th, when under
an Act of the Confederate Congress, the army was re-organized.
The numbers in each military organization
had become so reduced that it was found necessary to
consolidate divisions into brigades, brigades into regiments,
and regiments into battalions. The 1st, 57th and
63rd Ga. were merged into the First Volunteer Regiment
of Ga., the 54th Ga. forming a battalion. The Oglethorpes
alone of the ten companies of our regiment, retained
their separate and original organization. Lieut. Wilber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>force
Daniel was made captain, with Charles T. Goetchius
and Geo. W. McLaughlin as first and second lieutenants.
Lieut. A. W. Blanchard was promoted to the
captaincy of Co. K, formed of companies E, F, and G,
and the writer, at Capt. Blanchard's request, was made
an officer in the same company, Will Dabney being also
transferred and given the position of orderly sergeant.
I am glad to be able to say to the credit of the Oglethorpes,
that the consolidation not only failed to reduce
the rank of any of their officers, as was the case in other
companies, but that it resulted in the promotion of them
all and in addition to this another company in the new
regiment was practically officered by them.</p>

<p>As soon as the re-organization had been completed
we began our southward march, passing through Raleigh
and Chapel Hill and reaching the vicinity of Greensboro
on April 16th. Appomatox had become history, and
a truce of ten days was agreed upon by Johnston and
Sherman, with a view to ending the war. On the 17th
and 18th rumors were current that the army was to be
surrendered and numbers of the troops left their commands,
unwilling to submit to the seeming humiliation.
To stop this movement Johnston issued an order informing
the army that negotiations for peace were going on
between the governments, and on April 28th the terms
of the Military Convention, agreed to on the 26th were
published. Lee's surrender had shattered the last hope
of Confederate success and a prolongation of the strug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>gle
would have been a useless and criminal sacrifice of
life.</p>

<p>A report of President's Lincoln assassination had
reached our camp and a number of us went over one
night to the quarters of Gen. John C. Brown, our division
commander, to ascertain the correctness of the rumor.
To the question, "Is Lincoln dead?" he replied,
"Yes, he's very dead." "Well, General, what do you
propose to do when you get home?" "I am going to join
the Quakers," he said, "My fighting days are over." On
May 2d our paroles arrived and were signed up and on
the 3rd we began our march for Georgia, making the
trip of 230 miles in 11 days. In evidence of South Carolina's
loyalty to the cause, even in its dying hours, I recall
the fact that while passing through its territory on
our homeward march, no man or woman refused to accept
Confederate money for any purchase made by us.
Although then</p>

<p>Reaching Augusta May 13th, we divided the teams
allowed us for transportation and with one dollar and
twenty cents in silver paid us at Greensboro for fifteen
months' service, we bade our comrades in arms a tender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and affectionate farewell, broke ranks for the last time,
and turned our weary steps homeward.</p>

<p>The flag we had followed for four years was furled
forever and the Southern Confederacy was a thing of
the past.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>I would be doing violence to the expressed wishes of
an old comrade and messmate, one whose friendship for
me was born at the camp fire, and was strengthened and
intensified by common hardship and danger, if I were
to close these records without adding a word in behalf
of the cause for which we fought. Were these four
wasted years? Was the war on the part of the South only
a wicked rebellion, as our Northern friends have been
pleased to term it?</p>

<p>Speaking only for myself as a humble unit in the four
years' struggle, and yet feeling assured that I fairly represent
a vast majority of my Confederate comrades, I
can say that I never kneeled at my mother's knee in
childhood with a deeper sense of duty nor a purer feeling
of devotion than impelled me when, with her tear-wet
kiss upon my boyish lips, I left the old homestead
to take my humble station under the "Stars and Bars."
I can say further that looking backward over the record
of the years, that Providence has kindly granted me, no
four of them come back to me with a deeper sense of
satisfaction than those which marked my service as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Confederate soldier. The convictions formed in those old
days of the absolute righteousness of the cause for which
we fought have only strengthened with the passing
years. While the South failed in its purpose to secure
separate national existence I have never felt that in the
struggle it had anything to regret but failure. Despite
the tremendous odds against which it fought, despite
the fact that it entered the contest without an army,
without a navy, without military supplies, with the sentiment
of its border States hopelessly divided, and with
the sympathies of the world against it, but for the loss
of its ablest Western leader in his first battle, it would
not, as I believe, have had even failure to regret. If Albert
Sidney Johnston had not fallen on that fateful April
Sabbath when Grant's demoralized and beaten legions
were cowering under the river bank at Shiloh, he would,
in my belief, have duplicated in the West, Lee's victories
in the East and Appomatox and Greensboro would have
had no place in Southern history. Even in '64, if President
Davis had heeded the appeals of Gov. Brown and
Gen. Johnston, of Howell Cobb and Joe Wheeler, Sherman's
constant apprehension during the Dalton and Atlanta
campaign would have become a reality. Forrest,
the greatest cavalry leader of the war, and, in the opinions
of Lee, Johnston and Sherman, the most brilliant
genius developed by it, would have been turned loose on
Sherman's rear; Atlanta would never have fallen,
Lincoln would have failed of re-election and the "re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>construction"
that followed in the wake of the war would
have been confined to the geography of the country,
rather than to Southern State governments at the hands
of carpet-baggers. Lincoln expected such a result and
bent every energy to end the war before the peace sentiment
of the North could find expression in the election
of McClellan. The failure to utilize Forrest's genius in
the destruction of Sherman's communication, the removal
of Johnston and the resultant fall of Atlanta, turned
the tide and the Confederacy was doomed.</p>

<p>Defeat brought with it some measure of humiliation,
and yet it is pleasant to remember that our short-lived
republic stands in history today "without a blot upon its
honor and with no unrighteous blood upon its hands."
With its territory scorched and scarred by a foe, in whose
military lexicon the word "humanity" found no place, the
South struck no blow below the belt. It fought with
rifles, not with firebrands, and made its war upon armed
foes, not upon helpless women and children. It had no
brutal Shermans, nor Sheridans, nor Butlers, nor Hunters
in its ranks, but it is pleasant to know that it left
to the world the legacy of a Lee and a Stonewall Jackson,
whose military record stands unmarred by the faintest
shadow of a stain and unparalleled in Anglo Saxon
history. While the North fought, not for the flag, not
through sympathy for the slave, but by the admission of
Lincoln himself, just as surely for commercial greed as
if the dollar mark had been woven into every banner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
that led its hosts to battle, it is a pleasant reflection that
the South sought only to free itself from an alliance that
had become offensive and dangerous to its liberties. And
while Lincoln has been canonized as a martyred saint, I
am glad to know that Jefferson Davis or Robert E. Lee
would have suffered a thousand martyrdoms before they
would have penned a proclamation deliberately intended
not only to beggar a whole people but to subject innocent
and helpless women and children to the horrors of
a servile insurrection.</p>

<p>And so I feel assured that when in coming years posterity,
unblinded by prejudice or passion, shall give to
all the claimants in the Pantheon of Fame their just and
proper meed, as high in purest patriotism as any rebel
that fell at Lexington or starved at Valley Forge, as
high in lofty courage as any hero that rode with Cardigan
at Balaclava or marched with Ney at Waterloo, or
fell beneath the shadow of the spears with brave Leonidas,
will stand the rebel soldier of the South, clad in his
tattered grey, beneath whose faded folds is shrined the
Stars and Bars of an invisible republic, that lives in history
only as a memory.</p>

<h3>OGLETHORPE INFANTRY, CO. B.</h3>

<p>When the Oglethorpes offered their services to the
Confederate government in '61 the married men in its
ranks were, by a vote of the Company, excluded from the
enlistment except as commissioned officers. After the
departure of the Company for the seat of war the members,
who were left behind, effected a new organization
and were known as "Co. B." Their purpose was to organize
for home defence, but in November, '61, they
were ordered to Savannah by Gov. Brown, and were
assigned to the 9th Regiment Ga. State troops, then in
process of formation. Gen. W. H. T. Walker had thrown
up his commission in Virginia because President Davis
had seen fit to take from him the brigade he had organized
and had assigned to its command his brother-in-law,
Dick Taylor, who was subordinate in rank to every
Colonel in the brigade. Gen. Walker could not brook
what he deemed a pure case of nepotism, and on his return
to Georgia he was placed in command of the brigade
of State troops, to which the Oglethorpes, as Co.
A, 9th Ga., had been assigned. The Company, on account
of their proficiency in the manual of arms and in
company evolution, became a sort of pet of Gen. Walker's
and when his quarters were visited by ladies from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Savannah the Oglethorpes were ordered out to drill for
the benefit of his fair guests. Mr. Frank H. Miller, who
was a lieutenant in the company and afterwards adjutant
of the regiment, by Gen. Walker's appointment, relates
a characteristic incident that occurred during the General's
service at Savannah as his commanding officer.
One of his men had "run the blockade," had spent the
night in Savannah and while hustling back to camp in
the early morning hours, was overhauled by the sergeant
in charge of the guard at the General's quarters. The
soldier did not relish the idea of being placed under arrest
for his escapade and backing himself against a tree
he drew his knife and threatened to carve up any man
who laid hands on him. The noise awakened Gen. Walker,
who was sleeping in a tent near by, and rushing out
en deshabille, he shouted, "What the d&mdash;l is the matter
out here?" The sergeant, who seemed to be suffering
with a nervous chill, stammered out, "He won't be arrested,
General. He says he'll kill anybody that touches
him." The General rushed up to the man and said, "Give
me that knife, sir." The soldier handed it over with a
smile on his face and the General saw as he took it that
the weapon was entirely bladeless. Turning to the sergeant
he said, "Turn that man loose. I won't have any
man arrested who can back out a whole guard with a
knife that hasn't got a blade in it." And the "blockade
runner" went scot free.</p>

<p>In May, '62, their six months term of service having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
expired, the company was mustered out at Augusta. A
majority of its members soon effected a re-organization
for regular Confederate service and the new company
was ordered to Corinth, Miss., and for a time was assigned
to the 5th Ga. Regiment, then serving in the brigade
of Gen. John K. Jackson. Before leaving this camp
the 2d Battalion Ga. Sharpshooters was organized, under
the command of Major Jesse J. Cox, of Alabama,
and the Oglethorpes became Co. C of that famous organization
known in the Army of Tennessee, as "Cox's
Wild Cats." For the remaining years of the war this battalion
was identified with every movement and did gallant
service in every engagement of the Western Army.
As "Sharp-shooters" it fell to their lot to serve almost
continuously on the skirmish line, opening every battle
in which their division was engaged. Transferred from
Tupelo to Chattanooga in the summer of '62, they took
part in Bragg's Kentucky campaign and at its close were
stationed for a time at Knoxville and then at Bridgeport,
rejoining Bragg again in time to participate in the battle
of Murfreesboro, Dec. 31, '62. During that engagement,
at Gen. Polk's request, the battalion, with Jackson's brigade,
was temporarily detached from Hardee's corps
and was sent into the famous cedar thicket where they
were exposed to the concentrated fire of Rosecranz's
parked artillery and lost half their number. Among the
casualties sustained by the Oglethorpes was the loss of
their gallant commander, Capt. E. W. Ansley, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
brave color-bearer of the battalion, Edward H. Hall.
Lieut. M. G. Hester succeeded to the captaincy and the
colors were given to Geo. F. Bass of the Oglethorpes,
who seem to have furnished all the ensigns for the battalion.
During the Kentucky campaign the colors had
been borne by Corporal M. V. Calvin, and after the
transfer of Bass to another command, they were entrusted
to another Oglethorpe, Wm. Mulherin, who carried
them with marked gallantry until his capture at the battle
of Nashville, in the winter of '64.</p>

<p>Through the battles of Chickamauga and Missionary
Ridge, with Johnston through the hundred days from
Dalton to Atlanta, and with Hood at Franklin and
Nashville, the "Wild Cats" sustained their hard-earned
reputation as a fighting organization, closing up their
soldierly record with the surrender of Johnston's army
at Greensboro in April, '65, at which date Lieut. George
P. Butler was in command of the Oglethorpes. A number
of the gallant survivors of the company are still living
in or near Augusta, among them, Orderly Sergeant
Wm. K. Thompson, Serg. M. V. Calvin, Corp. Brad
Merry, Corp. W. H. Miller, Musician W. B. White,
Evans Morgan, W. H. Hendrix and W. D. Shaw.</p>


<h3>SHIPS THAT DID NOT PASS IN THE NIGHT.</h3>

<p>Brad Merry's name recalls an incident that occurred
at the Charleston Reunion in 1899. Brad and the writer
had agreed to make the homeward trip together. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
reaching the train I failed to meet him. The coaches were
crowded, but I finally secured a seat with a stranger, who
after the formation of a railroad acquaintance, proved
to be Rev. T. P. Cleveland, living near Atlanta. After a
pleasant chat about our mutual friends in Atlanta and
elsewhere, I strolled through the train in search of my
friend Brad. Finding him in a forward coach, I chanced
to say, with no special reason for making the statement,
that I had a seat with a Rev. Mr. Cleveland. "What's his
full name?" asked Brad, with a look of interest. "T. P."
I replied. "Tom Cleveland! Why there isn't a man in
the world I'd rather see. We were old schoolmates.
Where is he?" Taking him back to my coach I said,
"Mr. Cleveland, here's an old friend of yours, Brad Merry."
The meeting was a very joyous one. As the glamour
of the old days came over them and with glowing faces
and happy hearts they talked of the long ago, a lady
stepped across the aisle and said, "Didn't I hear this
gentleman call you Mr. Brad Merry?" "You certainly
did, madam," said Brad. "Why, Mr. Merry, I know
you. Your battalion was camped near my father's house
for a long time and you and your comrades came over
nearly every evening and sang for us. We had mighty
pleasant times together in those old war days." Brad's
smile reached from his chin to the back of his neck as he
grasped her hand and said, "I am delighted to see you
again. I remember you distinctly. Your father had three
girls, Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee." "Well," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
she, "this is Virginia," and pointing across the aisle to
her sister, "there's Alabama." The ride to Augusta was
no longer tiresome or tedious. In the renewal of their
old time acquaintance and the revival of so many personal
memories the hours sped swiftly and when I left
the train Brad was using all his persuasive power to
induce the entire party to stop over at Berzelia and
brighten for a time his Pinetucky home.</p>

<p>They were strangers to me, but I enjoyed their happiness
and was glad to have been the unconscious instrument
in bringing them together again. But for the accident
of my finding that special seat vacant, these four
ships would have "passed in the night," possibly to hail
each other no more until with wearied sail they cast their
final anchor in the harbor that lies beyond the sunset.</p>

<h2><a name="SUPPLEMENT" id="SUPPLEMENT"></a>SUPPLEMENT.</h2>


<p>As this is my first, and will probably be my last attempt
at authorship, in deference to the possibly too
partial judgment of friends, I have ventured to include
in the volume two additional sketches in no way connected
with the memories, which precede them. Yielding
to the same kindly criticism I have added also a war
poem, intended to perpetuate an incident whose hardly
paralleled pathos has not, I trust, been marred by the
poetic dress in which I have attempted to preserve it.</p>


<h3>ONE OF MY HEROES.</h3>

<p>Personal courage, when from the lack of selfish ends,
it rises to the plane of real chivalry, has always met with
willing homage from the hearts of men. I do not know
that hero-worship has entered largely into my own mental
or moral makeup, and yet for thirty years and more
my heart has paid its silent and yet earnest tribute to
one, who in unadulterated grit and innate chivalry was
the peer of any man I have ever known. I have called
him my hero, but he was mine, perhaps, only by right of
discovery. I found him in a little Florida village in the
winter of '66. There was nothing in his appearance to
indicate the hero. No title, civil or military added dignity
to his name. So far as I know no stars or bars had
gilded the old grey uniform he had laid aside with Lee's
surrender. He was simply plain Bob Harrison. Of his
lineage or earthly history I learned but little. I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
that he was the son of a Methodist minister who, some
years before, had moved to Florida from South Carolina,
and who, by right of apostolical succession, was not only
a good preacher but a good fisherman as well. I know,
further, that in one of the battles in Virginia my friend
had been shot through the lungs and had been left upon
the battlefield to die.</p>

<p>The surgeons in their hurried rounds passed by on
the other side, declining to waste their time on one, who
in a few short hours would be beyond the reach of human
aid. Despairing of any relief from them, he had tied
his handkerchief around his chest to staunch the life
blood that was ebbing away, and through the long, long
lonely night had waited for death or help to come. On
the morrow the burial corps had found him still living,
and in the hospital he was nursed back to partial health
again. The press had placed his name among the dead,
and far away in his Southern home loving ones mourned
for him until one summer's day his feeble footsteps on
the walk and his pallid arms about their necks brought
to their hearts a resurrection just as real as that which
gladdened Mary and Martha at the tomb of Lazarus.
Of his service as a soldier I know no more than I have
written. My claim for him is based upon incidents that
occurred when the war had ended and his record as a
soldier had been made up.</p>

<p>At the date and in the section of which I write the
tide of lawlessness that followed in the wake of war had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
not yet reached its ebb. During my stay a party of toughs
came to the village and for a week or more terrorized
the place. An effort was made to secure their arrest by
civil process, but from lack of nerve in the officers, or
failure to secure a posse, the effort failed and the gang
was having its own sweet will without let or hindrance.</p>

<p>At this juncture Bob Harrison rode into the village one
day from his country home. The lady, at whose boarding
house these men were stopping, told him of their
misdoings. He was living six miles away and had no
personal grievance against them. His wounded lung had
never healed and frequent hemorrhages from it had paled
the color in his cheeks and weakened a body none too
strong when in perfect health. But the appeal stirred
the chivalry of his nature and he did not hesitate a moment.
He went to them and in vigorous English denounced
their conduct as ungentlemanly and dishonorable
and told them it must stop.</p>

<p>That afternoon a challenge came to him to meet them
at a designated place next morning to answer for the
insult he had given. He rode in before breakfast and at
the appointed hour he was promptly on hand armed with
a brace of pistols and a bowie knife. For three hours he
offered satisfaction in any shape they chose to take it, and
with any weapon they might select, but his nerve had
cowed them and the offer was declined. Then he said to
their leader, "You have been making threats against my
friend, Charlie P&mdash; for some fancied wrong. He has a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
wife and children to mourn him if he falls. I have none.
I stand in his shoes today and any satisfaction you claim
from him you can get from me here and now." The bully
failed to press his claim. The gang soon left the village
and quiet reigned again.</p>

<p>A short time prior to this incident a young lady had
made her home in the village&mdash;a stranger, without relatives
or friends. A citizen of the place taking advantage
of her unprotected condition, began to circulate rumors
reflecting on her character. These reports reached Bob
Harrison's ears. She was bound to him by no ties of
blood or special friendship, but her helplessness was
claim enough. He called on the author of the slander
and asked to see him privately. The man showed him
into a room and Bob locked the door and put the key
in his pocket. "Now, Mr &mdash;," he said, "you have circulated
slanders about Miss &mdash;. She has no relative here to
protect her and I have come to put a stop to it. I don't
propose to take any advantage of you. I am going to
lay these two pistols on this table. You will stand with
your face to that wall and I will stand with my face to
this. When I give the word if you can secure a pistol
first you are at liberty to shoot. If I get one first, I am
going to shoot. You have got to do that or you have got
to sit down at this table and sign a "lie bill." The man
looked into Bob's eyes a moment and said, "I'll sign the
lie bill," and Miss &mdash;'s name was safe from slanderous
tongues from that day on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>In neither of these cases did he have the slightest personal
interest.</p>

<p>His conduct was prompted solely by the chivalry
of the man. He impressed me as ordinarily one of the
gentlest and mildest mannered of men and yet I believe
he would have led a forlorn hope to certain death without
a tremor.</p>

<p>With the close of winter I returned to my Georgia
home and over the gulf of silence that has intervened
since that spring day in '67, no tidings have come to me
of my friend, Bob Harrison. If he still lives my heart
goes out in tender greeting to him today, and if he
sleeps beneath the daisies I trust this little tribute to his
worth will cause the sod that lies above him to press
none the less lightly over his manly heart.</p>


<h3>BEN HILL AND THE DOG.</h3>

<h3>A REMINISCENCE.</h3>

<p>Just fifty years ago in the unceiled, unpainted and
largely unfurnished rooms of an "Old Field School,"
holding a blue-backed speller in my boyish hands, I sat
with a row of barefoot urchins on a plain pine bench
and watched with sleepy eyes the mellow sunshine creeping
all too slowly towards the 12 o'clock mark cut by
the teacher into the school room floor. This primitive
timepiece that marked the boundary line between school
hours and the midday intermission, known in schoolboy
vernacular as "playtime," was never patented, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
it had the happy faculty of never running down and
never needing repairs. To the student of today reveling
in the luxuriant appointments of the present public
school system there may come sometimes a touch of
pity for the simple methods and the meagre equipment
of the old field school, whose teachers in addition to the
inconvenience of having to "board around," were sometimes
forced to receive partial compensation for their
work in home made "socks." Such of my readers as may
be disposed to discredit the free and unlimited knitting
of socks as a circulating medium for the payment of
school salaries, are respectfully referred to my friend,
W. J. Steed, for the historical accuracy of this statement.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;and yet, minimizing as we may the limited
advantages of those old school days in the '40's, and
magnifying as we do the wondrous advance in educational
methods and appliances in all grades from the
kindergarten to the university, the fact remains that
"there were giants in those days" who seem to have no
successors. Examples might be multiplied both in our
state and national life, but I give only two. The places of
George F. Pierce in the pulpit and of Benjamin H. Hill
in the forum and on the hustings have never been filled.
It may be true that Dame Nature requires after the production
of great men a period of repose and rest, and if
my limited observation is not at fault she is enjoying a
good long nap. Whatever may have been the explana<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>tion
of the fact mentioned, the privilege of hearing these
men in their palmy days, of feeling the "cold chills"
creep up the spinal column as they soared to the empyrean
heights of impassioned oratory, of losing consciousness
of time and place and environment under the
magic spell of their almost superhuman eloquence, furnished
some measure of compensation for the meagre
advantages, on educational lines, of the last generation.</p>

<p>The writer's first opportunity to hear Ben Hill occurred
at Mount Moriah camp ground, in Jefferson county,
in the presidential campaign of 1856. On the disintegration
of the old Whig party Mr. Hill had aligned himself
with its residuary legatee, the American party, and was
canvassing the State as an elector on the Fillmore ticket.
He was 33 years of age, just in the rosy prime of a superb
physical and intellectual manhood. I was only a boy
and knew nothing of parties or party politics, but I remember
that for three hours and more he held the rapt
and untiring interest and attention of that vast audience.</p>

<p>At the close of the speech Major Stapleton announced
that a messenger had been sent to Mr. Stephens asking
a division of time with Mr. Hill at the former's appointment
in Burke county, on the next day. Mr. Hill was
sitting on the pulpit steps, and when the announcement
closed he said, "Yes, I am not afraid to meet "Little
Aleck," nor big Aleck, nor big Bob added to them," alluding
to Mr. Toombs. Mr. Stephens did not consent,
but met Mr. Hill afterwards at Lexington, Ga., in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
same campaign. Out of this debate grew Mr. Stephens'
challenge and Mr. Hill's refusal to accept it, an incident
which had large influence in ending the reign of the code
duello in Georgia.</p>

<p>Two years later I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Hill
again in the State campaign for governor. A joint canvass
of the State had been in progress, but after a few
discussions Governor Brown found that he was no match
for Mr. Hill on the "stump," and he wisely cancelled
further engagements. In giving his reasons for such
action he said that Mr. Hill was too much of a sophist,
that he could make the worse appear the better cause,
and to enforce the point he related the "pig and puppy"
anecdote, a favorite illustration with political speakers in
those days. In the speech I refer to, delivered at Covington,
Ga., Mr. Hill gave his opponent the benefit of a
statement of the reasons he had assigned for his withdrawal,
with the anecdote included, and then with the
smile that always gave premonition of a happy retort, he
said, "And now, fellow-citizens, in this campaign I have
made no effort to make anything out of anybody but
Mr. Brown, and if I have made nothing better than a
pig or a puppy it was the best I could do with the material
I had to work upon."</p>

<p>Mr. Hill never employed the anecdote argument in his
speeches, but if used against him no man of his time or
perhaps of any other time was able to turn its edge more
readily or more effectively on his opponent I recall only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
one passage from the address and as it has not been
preserved in his published speeches I give it in illustration
of his style at that date. After disposing of his opponent
and the State campaign he turned his attention
to national issues and in urging his audience to resist
Northern encroachments on their rights closed a burst
of impassioned oratory with these words: "Has the
spirit of Southern chivalry folded its wings for an eternal
sleep in the grave of Calhoun? Shall the breezes,
which blow from the 'cowpens' where the infant days of
Jackson were spent, now fan the brows of a nation of
slaves? Rise, freemen of Georgia! Arise in your might.
Shake off this Delilah of party for she is an harlot and
will betray you to your destruction. Arise! drive back
the invader from your thresholds, or like Samson of old,
pull down the pillars of the temple and perish in one
common ruin." Its effect upon the audience may be inferred
from the fact that it has lingered in my memory
more than forty years. I heard Mr. Hill no more until
some years after the war. His nerve in putting an end to
the seizure of cotton by Federal agents in the South in
'65, his "Davis Hall" and "Bush Arbor" speeches and
his "Notes on the Situation" had given him the very
highest place in Southern esteem and affection. And
then came his acceptance of an interest in the State Road
Lease and his speech at the "Delano Banquet," which
placed him under the ban of popular distrust and postponed
the day when Southern character and Southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
history was to find its brave and complete vindication at
his hands in the halls of Congress. During this shadowed
period in his life I heard him several times in Atlanta,
and on one of these occasions occurred the incident
which forms the title of this sketch. Chafing under the
criticisms and abuse to which he had been subjected he
boldly defended the consistency of his record and pointed
proudly to the day in '65 when the lips of every public
man in Georgia were sealed except his own. "And
now, my friends," said he, "when the lion of military
government had prostrate Georgia in its cruel grasp,
these men, who are now decrying me, were hiding away
in quiet places afraid to face him. But when largely
through my persistent efforts his clutch was loosened
and he was recalled to his den in Washington, the whole
breed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cur of low degree,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">left their hiding places and came out barking, not at the
lion, but at me, yelping, "Radical!" "Radical!" "Radical!"
The words had barely left his lips when a huge dog
standing in the centre of the aisle, began barking loudly
and vigorously, with his eyes fixed on Mr. Hill. I do not
know that the speaker, in imitation of a certain minister's
reputed habit of inserting, "Cry here," at the close
of the pathetic passages in his manuscript, had inserted
"Bark here" in his notes, but I do know that the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>promptu
illustration fitted in so pertinently that the
storm of applause, that greeted it, would have lifted the
roof if such a result had been possible. For several minutes
there was perfect pandemonium. As the wave of
sound rolled and swelled and rose and fell to rise in
larger volume than before the speaker faced the audience
with the shadow of a smile upon his face and when the
last ripple of applause had died away he said: "My
friends, I meant no reflection on that dog."</p>

<p>I have had the privilege of hearing Toombs, Stephens,
Johnson and Howell Cobb, the first two, a number of
times. I claim no ability to make intelligent comparison
among these distinguished Georgians. But basing an estimate
simply upon their effect upon myself and upon
others as I have observed it, I should say that while in
epigrammatic force, in the ability to pack thought into
limited space, Mr. Toombs had no equal among them,
yet in effective oratory, in the power to sway an audience
at his will, whether in the domain of ice-cold logic
or in the higher realms where only angels soar, Mr. Hill
probably towered above them all. The peroration to his
appeal for the pardon of Wm. A. Choice had few equals
in all the range of English forensic literature. It has not
been preserved, and in the forty years that have elapsed
since its delivery, my memory retains but a single sentence,
and with that I close this sketch: "Even from the
lips of the murdered man, a voice comes back to us today,
as soft as evening zephyrs through an orange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
grove and as warm as an angel's heart. 'Forgive him,
save him, for he knew not what he did.'"</p>

<h3>THE REBEL CHAPLAIN AND THE DYING BOY
IN BLUE.</h3>

<p>The touching incident recorded in the following
verses occurred on a bloody Western battlefield in the
old war days in the '60's. Rev. J. B. McFerrin, formerly
of Nashville, Tenn., and now in Heaven, an able and
honored minister of the Methodist church, and for four
years a Confederate chaplain in the army of Tennessee,
was the Christian hero of this tenderly pathetic story.
His untiring devotion to the sick and wounded amid the
dangers and hardships of camp and field are gratefully
remembered by his surviving comrades, while his gentle
kindness to a stricken foe, will be embalmed in the loving
memory of every veteran of both the "Blue and
Grey."</p>

<span class="i0">And now the cannon's roar was dumb,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From out the lines of faded grey<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A rebel chaplain made his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On mercy's kindly mission bent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He kneeled beside a stricken foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose life was ebbing fast away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then in gentle words and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He asked if he might read and pray?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No, no," the wounded man replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"My throat is parched, my lips are dry,"<br /></span>

<span class="i1">"Oh, give me water, or I'll die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The chaplain hurried o'er the strand<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then in the wintry twilight air<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In tender tones the good man read<br /></span>
